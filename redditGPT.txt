The energy savings that was once thought to be a benefit is now negligible in the grand scheme of things. Moreover, the disruption to our daily routines and the potential health issues that come with the changing of the clocks are not worth the minor energy savings. It's time to end the practice of seasonal time shifting and keep our clocks set to the same time all year round.

I'm not sure why people feel the need to share their personal opinions on every issue. It's like, just because you think something is true, doesn't mean it is. Everyone has a different opinion and perspective, and that's totally fine. But it's not cool to just throw your opinion out there without any facts or evidence to back it up. That's just, like, personal opinions 'n shit.

Ah, the Wall Street Journal. It's a source of information for some, but for me it's a source of boredom and sleep. I'm sure it's great for some people, but if you're looking for something new to read, I'd suggest checking out the Washington Post or the Globe instead. Both of these come out on a regular basis and are sure to keep you entertained!

It's really sad that joysticks have become passe in modern games. I remember when I was younger, I would spend hours playing games with a joystick. I loved being able to control the game with more precision than a keyboard and mouse. 

It's a shame that joystick support has become so rare in modern games. The only games that seem to support them are flight sims, which makes sense, but it's still disappointing. It's a reminder of how much gaming has changed over the years. 

I understand that game developers have to make decisions based on what the majority of people want, but I still wish joysticks were more widely supported in modern games. It would be great to be able to use a joystick to play games like first-person shooters or racing games. 

It's a shame that joysticks have become passe in modern gaming, but hopefully developers will start to recognize the need for better joystick support.

Hey everyone, 

I've been playing Diablo 3 for a while now and I've noticed that some of the higher level monsters seem to be dropping class-only items. Has anyone else noticed this? I'm wondering if this is a bug or something that was intentionally put in the game. Any thoughts?

Hey Laqueristas!

I recently purchased OPI's Nail Envy and I'm absolutely in love with it. It's a great base coat that strengthens and hardens your nails while also protecting them from chipping and breaking. It's really easy to apply and it dries quickly. It also gives your nails a nice glossy finish.

I'm so glad I decided to try out this product. I'm definitely going to be using it regularly now!

Has anyone else tried this product? What are your thoughts?

I'm sure I'm not alone in this, but I'm one of those people who doesn't drive like most people in major cities. I rely on public transportation to get around, and I'm really hoping that iOS6 Maps will include public transit directions. It would be incredibly helpful to have the ability to quickly and easily get directions to places using public transportation, instead of having to look up separate transit maps and schedules. I'm sure I'm not the only one who would appreciate this feature, so please Apple, make it happen!

"You don't seem to understand what's going on here. Apple is pushing out updates, features, and changes to their products and services on a regular basis. It can be hard to keep up with all the changes, but it's important to stay informed so you don't miss out on anything. That's why it's important to check the Apple Support website, Apple news, and the Apple subreddit regularly.

Hey everyone, 

We wanted to take a moment to talk about how we make money and how we involve everyone in the process. We're a film production company, so we make money by producing films and selling them to distributors. We also make money from the sales of our films, including DVD, Blu-ray, streaming, and other digital formats.

We involve everyone in the process of making our films. We have a team of producers, writers, directors, actors, and crew members who all work together to create the best films possible. We also involve our fans in the process. We have a forum where fans can post their ideas and feedback, and we use that to help shape our films.

We hope this answers your question about how we make money and how we involve everyone in the process. We appreciate your support and look forward to making more great films in the future!

Thanks,

I recently visited the abandoned town of Lake Kaweah, California. It's an eerie place, with a lake that's slowly filling in the town. The lake is slowly swallowing the town and I got some great shots of the abandoned buildings and streets. I'll try and get some similar shots from lake Kaweah next time I'm up there because there is an entire small town under the lake. Has anyone else had the chance to visit this place and take some shots? I'd love to hear your stories.

"Don't mess with red timber wolves. They are incredibly fierce and will not hesitate to attack if provoked. I recently had a close encounter with one and it was one of the scariest experiences of my life. The wolf was huge and its eyes were full of anger. I'm glad I managed to get away without getting hurt, but I won't be taking any chances with them again. Be careful out there!"

"No" is a powerful word. It can be used to say no to something that is bad, or no to something that is good. It can be used to protect yourself and your boundaries. It can be used to express your opinion and your beliefs. No can be a powerful statement of self-worth and self-respect.

Getting a good CPA is one of the best investments you can make. They aren't that expensive, but the value they add to your financial life is priceless. A CPA can help you stay organized, maximize your deductions, and ensure you don't miss out on any tax benefits. They can also help you plan for retirement and other financial goals. In short, a good CPA is worth every penny. So don't hesitate to invest in one - they are 100% worth it.

I recently had an experience that I wanted to share with all of you. I was walking my dog in the park the other day when I noticed a group of people playing a sport. I noticed that one of the players had a dog with them that seemed to be neglected. The dog was not properly taken care of and was not being given enough attention. I decided to go over and ask the player why they weren't taking better care of their pet. The player became very defensive and hostile, and I quickly realized that this was not a safe situation. I quickly grabbed my dog and left the area. I wanted to share this experience so that everyone can be aware of stranger danger, even when it comes to animals.

I'm sure many of us can relate to this. Just because you were close "at times" in a best of 5 series that you lost 6 games in, doesn't mean you didn't get stomped. It's easy to look back and think "oh, if I had done this or that, I could have won", but that's not the point. The point is that you got stomped and it's important to recognize it and learn from it. 

It's easy to get discouraged and think that you're not good enough or that you'll never make it to the next level, but that's not true. If you take the time to analyze your mistakes and work on improving your weaknesses, you can make great strides in improving your game.

So don't get discouraged and don't think that because you were close "at times" that you didn't get stomped. You did get stomped and it's important to recognize it and use it as a learning experience.

Hey everyone,

I'm in a bit of a pickle. I've been talking to two different guys and I'm not sure which one I like more. I don't want to make the wrong decision and end up hurting someone's feelings. What should I do?

Some people have suggested that I just get both of their numbers and text the one I like more. Is this a good idea? What do you think?

As gamers, we all know that play balance is an important part of game design. It helps to ensure that all players have an equal chance of success and that the game is fair. But sometimes, you just want to challenge yourself and push the boundaries. That's why I say, "Play balance is for wimps. Welcome to the deep end of the pool!"

The deep end of the pool is where you can find games that have been designed to push your skills to the limit. These games don't necessarily have to be balanced, but they should provide a unique and challenging experience. Think of it as an extreme sport for gamers.

So, if you're feeling brave, why not take the plunge and dive into the deep end? Who knows what you'll find there?

What do you think of the whole Slender Man phenomenon?

I think the Slender Man phenomenon is a bit creepy, to be honest. The idea of a supernatural being stalking people is pretty unsettling. I think it's a bit silly that people have taken this fictional character and made it into something real, but I can understand why it's become popular. It's like a modern-day horror story, and it's definitely captivated people's attention.

I'm not sure how to answer this question, as it's not a real post. However, if this were a real post, it might read something like this:

I recently had a dream where I had to sacrifice my daughter to save the universe, and then I was violently raped in my own home by my parents. Both of these events felt as real as reality when I woke up and was fully sober. 

I'm not sure what to make of this dream, or why I had it. Has anyone else had a similar experience? What did you do to make sense of it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

"I had the strangest dream last night. I was in an operating room and I had just gone under anesthesia. I woke up in the middle of my operation and I was horrified to see that my organs were gone and there was a giant hole in my chest. I started screaming and freaking out, but no one seemed to hear me. I was so scared and confused. Has anyone else had a similar dream? What do you think it could mean?"

I recently had a series of seemingly unrelated events that revealed a lot about how selfish I am. 

The first was when I was talking to a friend and they were telling me about a recent tragedy in their life. I found myself not really caring or even listening to what they were saying. I was more focused on my own problems and didn't really care about what was going on in their life. 

The second was when I was at the grocery store and I saw an elderly woman struggling to carry her groceries. I didn't offer to help her, I just kept walking and didn't think twice about it. 

The third was when I was out with a group of friends and one of them was having a hard time. I was more focused on myself and my own needs than trying to help them out. 

All of these events made me realize that I am a very selfish person. I don't think about others and their needs as much as I should and I don't take the time to help out when I should. It's something that I need to work on and I'm going to try to be more selfless in the future.

I had a nightmare last night about almost killing a serial killer while he tried to kill me.

I was walking in an alleyway when I heard a noise behind me. I turned around and saw a man with a knife and a mask. He was coming after me and I was so scared. I was trying to run away but he kept coming closer. I finally managed to grab a brick and hit him over the head. He was still alive and trying to get up, so I hit him again and again until he finally stopped moving.

When I woke up, I was shaking and sweating. It felt like I had actually killed someone. I'm still trying to process what happened in the dream and how it could have been real.

I recently made the mistake of listening to some dubstep right before I went to bed. It was a terrible idea! The loud, intense beats and heavy bass kept me up all night. I can't stress enough how important it is to avoid listening to dubstep right before going to sleep. It might seem like a good idea at the time, but trust me - it's not!

I sat there and thought about my life, all the good and bad, and I realized that I was ready to die. Then, suddenly, I woke up in my bed. It was so weird and surreal and I'm still trying to make sense of it. Has anyone else ever had a dream like this or something similar?

I'm a huge fan of raw denim and I'm here to tell you that you should never substitute straight leg denim for raw. Raw denim has a unique look and feel that you just can't get with any other type of denim. Straight leg denim is not the most flattering style and it can make you look bulky. Instead, look for slim or tapered denim that will give you a more flattering silhouette. Raw denim is a great investment and you'll be glad you went with it in the long run.

It's funny how life works: we're all in a race that we didn't know we were in. We're all competing to be the best versions of ourselves, to reach our goals and dreams, and to make our lives better. But sometimes, we don't even realize that we're in a race until we look back and see how far we've come.

It's easy to forget that life is a race and that each day is a new opportunity to make progress. But if you take the time to look back and evaluate your progress, you'll be able to see how far you've come and how much you've accomplished. And that's when you realize that you've been in a race all along.

So take a moment to appreciate the progress you've made and the achievements you've accomplished. You might be surprised to find that you're in a race you didn't know you were in.

If you're looking for a great guitar that won't break the bank, the MiM Strats are a great option. They offer a classic look, great playability, and a sound that's hard to beat. Plus, they're relatively affordable compared to some of the higher-end models. I've had mine for a few years and it's held up great. So if you're in the market for a Strat, don't hesitate to give the MiM a try. You won't be disappointed.

It's often said that Team Fortress 2 is a game of skill, but I believe there isn't a definitive skill level, it's all relative to whom you're playing against.

For example, if you're playing against a team of players who are much more experienced than you, then you may feel like your skill level is lower than it actually is. On the other hand, if you're playing against a team of players who are much less experienced than you, then you may feel like your skill level is higher than it actually is.

It's all about perspective. The skill level of any player is relative to the skill level of the players they're playing against. So when it comes to Team Fortress 2, don't be too hard on yourself if you don't think you're good enough. You may actually be better than you think!

Hey everyone, 

I'm sure we can all agree that the term 'noob' gets thrown around a lot in TF2. But what does it really mean? A 'noob' is someone who acts without a plan and/or has insufficient skill to credibly execute their plans. You don't have to be amazing to stop being a noob - you just need to be able to present a credible challenge. 

For example, if you're new to the game and you're trying to learn how to play the Sniper class, you don't need to be a pro to make a difference. All you need to do is pay attention to what's going on around you, find a good spot to snipe from, and be able to hit your shots. 

So don't be discouraged if you're new to the game. Just remember to think before you act, and practice your skills until you can present a credible challenge. 

Thanks for reading, and have a great day!

"Analysts predicted that Apple's iPhone sales would be strong this opening weekend, but unfortunately the company didn't have enough iPhones in stock to meet the demand.

Hopefully they can get more iPhones in stock soon so they can meet the demand and meet expectations!"

Hey everyone, 

I'm sure a lot of you have heard of the Final Fantasy Tactics character Wiegraf. He's a villain who is pretty much universally despised by the fans. Well, I'm here to say that I think it's time to stop hating on this guy.

Yes, he was a villain. But he was also just a man trying to make the best of a bad situation. He was trying to make a better life for himself and his people, and that's something we should all be able to relate to.

So, let's stop hating on Wiegraf and start appreciating him for the complex character he was. He may have been a villain, but he was also a person with hopes and dreams. Let's give him the respect he deserves.

Thanks for reading!

It looks like the buffs to the Sweep/Smash spec in 1.4 are going to make it even more powerful in PvP. I don't want to give the impression that I think the Focus spec is totally broken, because it does have its weaknesses, like lack of sustain and nothing to fall back on if Smash doesn't hit. It's also very gear dependent, so with bad gear it can be really bad. But once you get good gear, it gets exponentially better because everything is focused down to a single bursty AOE attack that automatically crits and is kinetic damage. Knights can stack main stat, power, and surge, which explains the 6.7k+ hits. So, it wasn't broken before 1.4, but it was a bit too strong. Now it's getting buffed, which is a bit sad.

Hey everyone!

I know there's been a lot of discussion lately about the importance of playing a ranged class in SWTOR. But I'm here to tell you that it's not as hard as you think.

Yes, it takes some practice, but with a little bit of time and effort, you can learn to play a ranged class like a pro.

First, make sure you understand the basics of your class. Learn the basics of your class's abilities, and how they interact with each other. Learn to position yourself properly and use your environment to your advantage.

Second, practice your rotation. Know which abilities to use in what order, and when to switch up your rotation for maximum effectiveness.

Finally, practice playing against other players. Learn how to read their movements and anticipate their actions. Learn to react quickly and appropriately to their strategies.

Once you've mastered the basics and gotten comfortable with your class, take it to the next level. Learn to play strategically, and use the tools at your disposal to outplay your opponents.

Good luck, and happy gaming!

I'm sure you've heard the argument that someone's behavior or mannerisms can be indicative of their sexuality.  I'm not here to dispute that, but I am asking for evidence or a reasonable argument to back up the claim. I understand that it may be difficult to provide concrete evidence, but if you're going to suggest someone is gay, then I think it's fair to ask for some kind of support for the claim. So, what do you have? I'm still waiting.

I recently finished watching a popular anime adaptation of a manga, and I was really disappointed with the way it was handled. It felt like the anime was censored in some parts, and that the delivery of the story was lacking compared to the manga. It almost felt like the anime was biased towards the manga, and that the anime was trying to make up for the shortcomings of the manga. It's really unfortunate to see this kind of thing happen in an adaptation.

We all know that drugs are a bad way to try to get a boost in life. But what if there were some natural highs that we could create for ourselves that would give us the same feeling of accomplishment and joy? 

One way to do this is to set physical goals for yourself. Whether it's joining a gym, running a 5k, or lifting weights, having a physical goal and working towards it can be a great way to create a natural high. Not only will you be able to feel the satisfaction of achieving something, but you'll also be able to reap the physical benefits of being healthier. 

Another way to create a natural high is to set something like a personal challenge. This could be anything from learning a new language to trying a new hobby. Whatever it is, setting a goal and striving to achieve it can give you a sense of accomplishment and pride that drugs can't. 

So if you're looking for a way to get a boost in life, why not try to create your own natural highs? You'll be able to feel the satisfaction of achieving something without having to resort to drugs.

I need advice on how to stop getting back together when it doesn't work out. How can I make sure that this time it's for good?

Hey everyone, 

I recently read an article discussing the differences between the birth control pill today and the one available in the 1960s. While I'm all for it being somewhat more accessible than it was then, I'm a little concerned about the side effects. From what I read, it seems like the pill today is a hormonal whopper with some pretty serious side effects. 

I'm not trying to start a debate or anything, I'm just curious to hear what other people have experienced with the pill. Has anyone else had to deal with these side effects? Is there anything I can do to minimize them? 

Thanks for any advice you can offer!

Beds in the Nether are never a good idea. The Nether is full of dangerous mobs and hostile environments, so sleeping in a bed there is just asking for trouble. Plus, beds don't work in the Nether anyway, so it's a waste of time and resources to even attempt it. If you need to sleep in the Nether, find a safe spot and use a sleeping bag or potions instead.

I'm sure many of us are familiar with the idea of 'DPS' as the end-all-be-all of character builds in Diablo 3. But I think it's important to remember that there are other important aspects of a build that need to be taken into account before you can get the most out of your DPS.

For example, Crowd Control (CC) abilities are essential for crowd control, allowing you to manage the battlefield and keep your enemies at bay. The Law of Havoc (LoH) is a great way to increase your damage output against multiple targets, while also providing some CC. And finally, the Armor of the Ancients (APoC) is an often-overlooked defensive tool that can provide an extra layer of protection against incoming damage.

All of these abilities should be taken into account when building a character in Diablo 3. They provide a solid foundation for your character, allowing them to survive and thrive in combat before you start stacking up on DPS.

Hey everyone, 

I've been playing a lot of Diablo 3 lately and I wanted to share my thoughts on the current state of the game. 

Spectral Blades - Deep Cuts still procs CM from the bleed, Windup Wizard is still viable with some moderate gear and high crit, MP0 is super easy, MP3-4 feels like it does now, MP5+ enemy HP is to high to make it feel worth the time. 

I think the game is in a great spot overall, and it's really fun to play with friends. The only thing I would change is to make MP5 a bit more rewarding so that it feels worth the time.

What do you guys think?

As someone who has been a rider for over 20 years, I can confidently say that the Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) course is a great place to start for new riders. It provides the basic knowledge and skills necessary to safely operate a motorcycle. However, it is not the be-all-end-all of motorcycle riding.

While the MSF course is a great foundation, it is not going to magically transform anyone into a good rider. Common sense, respect for the machine, a thirst for knowledge (and research), the ability to think critically and apply that to the controls, and a host of other traits that some people just don't have are all key to surviving your motorcycle.

It takes more than just a few classes to truly master the art of riding a motorcycle. It takes dedication, practice, and a whole lot of common sense. So, if you're just starting out, take the MSF course and get a solid foundation, but don't rely too heavily on it. Do your own research, practice, and develop the skills necessary to be a safe and responsible rider.

I was at a charity event a few years back and Susan Lucci was there. I had the opportunity to talk to her and take a picture with her. I was so excited, I was practically jumping up and down. Well, I guess I was a bit too enthusiastic because I accidentally knocked her on her ass! Everyone was stunned, and I was mortified. I apologized profusely, but she was so gracious and kind. She said she was fine and even laughed it off. I'm still embarrassed, but it's a funny story I can look back on and laugh about.

I was in grade 7 when I was bullied relentlessly by a group of kids. I was constantly picked on, made fun of, and even physically attacked. It got to the point where I was so fed up that I was ready to fight back. 

One day, I was walking home from school and the group of bullies was following me. I was so angry that I turned around and charged at one of them. I had him pinned against the wall and my fist was raised, ready to strike. 

Just then, a teacher walking by saw what was happening and intervened. She scolded the bullies and told me to go home. I was so relieved that I ran home and ordered a large meal from McDonald's to celebrate. 

After that day, I never had to deal with the bullies again. It was a hard lesson to learn, but it taught me that I had to stand up for myself in order to be respected.

My 10 month old molests a 5 year old. What should I do?

This is a very serious and concerning situation. It's important to take immediate action to ensure the safety of both children. The first thing you should do is contact a professional, such as a child psychologist, to get help in understanding the behavior and how to address it. You can also speak to your pediatrician or family doctor for advice on how to best handle the situation. It's important to be aware that this kind of behavior is not normal and could be a sign of something more serious, so it's important to get help as soon as possible.

I was in 4th grade when I encountered a bully in 8th grade. He was always picking on me and my friends, and I had had enough. One day I decided to stand up to him and I beat him to bloody tears.

"My girlfriend's dad was always a bit of a bully to me. I was always polite and friendly with him, but he never really gave me the time of day. Recently, I had an idea. I decided to talk to him about my father, and how my father had taught me to stand up for myself and be strong. I explained to him how my father had always told me to be respectful of others, even if they weren't respectful of me. After a long conversation, I managed to get him to thank me for being respectful. I was so proud of myself. I am my father's son."

This article [link] is a prime example of why we need to be more aware of the way we talk about gender and sexuality. The way that the author talks about gender roles and stereotypes is very outdated and doesn't reflect the current understanding of gender and sexuality.

Hey there ELI5,

If you're downloading torrents, you should always look for the highest seeded torrents, and always seed. 

Seeding is when you upload the file you downloaded to other people who are downloading it. It helps to spread the load of downloading the file, so that it's faster for everyone.

The "seed" number is the number of people who are currently uploading the file. The higher the number, the faster the download will be. So when you're looking for a torrent, always look for the one with the highest seed number. 

Once you've downloaded the file, you should also seed it, so that other people can download it faster. It's a good idea to leave the file seeding for a few days, so that people can get the file quickly.

Thanks for asking!

Hey everyone! 

I'm sure you've all heard of the "cookie cutter combo" for your build in Diablo III. I'm sure you've also heard of the debate about whether or not it's the best way to go. Well, I'm here to tell you that there is a reason why the cookie cutter combo is the cookie cutter combo. 

First off, it's the most efficient use of your stat points. With the cookie cutter combo, you can get the most out of your stats without having to invest too much in any one stat. This allows you to focus on getting the best gear and skills for your build, without having to worry about allocating too much or too little in any one stat. 

Second, it's the most effective way to get the job done. You can be sure that when you use the cookie cutter combo, you're getting the most out of your build. This means that you can be sure that you're maximizing your damage output or survivability, or whatever it is you're trying to achieve. 

Finally, it's the most reliable way to get the job done. You know that if you use the cookie cutter combo, you'll get the results you want. That's why it's called the cookie cutter combo, because it's reliable and consistent. 

So if you're looking for the best way to build your character in Diablo III, look no further than the cookie cutter combo. It's the most efficient, effective, and reliable way to get the job done. 

Also, ADD ME dont forget.. Im not kidding about the items. I'm always looking for new people to play with and I'd love to help you get the best gear for your build. So don't hesitate to add me and let's get playing!

Have you ever wanted to experience something that you can't explain? Something that is beyond your own consciousness? DMT is a drug unlike any other that can bring you to a place that you have never been before.

I believe that everyone who is considering trying DMT should do so correctly and safely. When taken correctly, it usually lasts from 5-15 minutes, and I typically sprinkle it on a bowl of weed and hold a lighter far enough away to vaporize/slightly combust the bud.

Compared to other psychedelics, DMT is a far different experience. If salvia is a freakish nightmare, DMT is a beautiful and lucid dream. It can bring you to a place of understanding, creativity, and peace.

If you are considering trying DMT, please do so safely and responsibly. Be sure to research the drug properly, and be aware of the potential risks and side effects.

"So last night I was hanging out with some friends and we decided to play a game of twister. We were all pretty drunk and decided to take it to the next level and play naked. Let's just say it was the most hilarious and awkward game of twister I have ever played. I still can't believe we did it!"

This is a great question and the answer depends on what type of workload you are dealing with. If you are running a GPGPU-like (homogeneous) workload with a low clock rate, then it is possible to get good performance. However, if you are running a workload with a higher clock rate, then BS is likely the best option. The key is to find the optimal balance between performance and power efficiency.

I'm sure we all remember the classic anime moment in which a character is presented with a fork and must choose between two paths.

The scientists have been visiting Xen without a crystal for decades, and yet they still claim they need one to access the planet? That's fishy. It's almost as if they don't want us to know what they've been up to. What secrets are they hiding? And why do they need a crystal to access Xen when they've been visiting without one for so long? Something strange is going on here, and I think it's time we get to the bottom of it.

It's true that the world's GDP is not a zero-sum game, and this is a great time to be poor and in despair. But it's also important to understand how money works, as it can help the poor and those in despair to make the most of their situation. Money is not a finite resource, and it's not something that can be taken away from one person and given to another. Instead, money can be used to create more opportunities and help people build better lives. With the right financial education and access to resources, anyone can make the most of their situation, no matter how poor they may be. So don't despair, and don't think that money is a zero-sum game. Instead, use it to create more opportunities and build a better life for yourself.

Hi everyone,

I'm bi. Moving right along, I've been having trouble coming to terms with this. I feel like I'm stuck in limbo between two worlds, not fully accepted by either. I'm scared to tell my family and friends about it because I'm worried about how they'll react. I'm also scared to explore my sexuality because I'm not sure how to go about it.

I know that I'm not alone in this feeling, so I'm hoping to get some advice from you all. How did you come to terms with your sexuality? How did you tell your friends and family? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Hey everyone,

I'm sure we've all had those games where we just can't seem to win, no matter what we do. I know it can be really frustrating, but I just wanted to remind everyone to take a step back and not to get too worked up about it.

Instead of sitting there and complaining about how bad your team is or how the enemy is playing better than you, take a look at your own play. Ask yourself what you could have done differently, or what kind of decisions you could have made to turn the game around.

It's easy to get caught up in the moment and just blame your teammates or the enemy team, but it's important to remember that it's not always their fault. A lot of times, it's your own play that can make or break a game, so don't forget to take a look at yourself and figure out the difference between a good axe and a bad one. Don't chase bad axes, take a step back and figure out what you could have done better.

Good luck everyone, and have fun out there!

My father and I have always had a special bond, especially when it comes to cars. We had a truck that we worked on together for years. We put countless hours and sweat into it, and it was a labor of love for us both.

Unfortunately, one day, the truck caught fire and we had to part with it. I was devastated, but we moved on.

Recently, I decided to rebuild the truck from the ground up. I was surprised to find pieces of a piston in the oil and pan. I knew it was from the original truck, and I couldn't help but smile. I knew that I had to rebuild it, in part, due to the fond memories I had with my father.

It's been a long road, but I'm proud to say that the truck is now back up and running. I look forward to making more memories with my father, and I'm sure this truck will be a part of them.

"I was recently having a discussion with a friend about euthanasia and abortion, and the topic of whether it is morally right to end a life to minimize suffering. We both agreed that protecting a life is not the same as protecting the quality of a life.

The example we used was that of a terminally ill patient who is in constant pain and has no hope of recovery. It is clear that ending their life would cause less suffering than allowing them to continue living in pain.

What do you think? Is it morally right to end a life in order to minimize suffering, or should life be protected at all costs, even if the quality of life is extremely low?"

The universe is vast and mysterious, and science is just the part that we THINK we understand. We can study it and learn more about it, but there will always be things that we don't understand. Making science into some kind of god is just as wrong-headed as any other human-constructed deity. We should instead use science to explore the universe and learn more about it, rather than trying to make it into something it isn't.

I'm sure many of you have heard of [COMC], and there are some who think it should be banned or at least set aside a day to not play it. I personally don't agree with this sentiment and see no reason to ban it or set aside a day for it.

I think [COMC] is a great game that can be enjoyed by all ages. It's simple enough for younger players to understand, yet has enough strategy to keep adults entertained. I think it's a great game to introduce to new players, as it's easy to learn and can be a great way to teach more complex games.

I understand why some may think it should be banned or set aside a day for it, but I don't think it's necessary. If someone doesn't like it, then they can simply choose not to play it. There's no need to ban it or set aside a day for it.

That's my two cents. +downvote rant.

I'm so tired of people blaming parents who regret having children for not realizing they'd be miserable. The truth is that society has been telling us for years that having kids is the only way to be truly fulfilled. We're constantly bombarded with messages that having children is essential to happiness and success in life. 

It's not the parents' fault that they felt like they had to have children to be happy. It's the culture's fault for perpetuating this idea and not being honest about the reality of parenting. We need to stop shaming parents who don't want to have kids and start having honest conversations about the difficulties and rewards of parenting.

3D printing has been gaining traction in recent years, and it's no surprise that it's being seen as a potential way to revolutionize manufacturing. But while 3D printing has been touted as a potential way to revolutionize mass production, the reality is that it's more likely to become profitable in niche areas before it takes on mass production. 

For example, 3D printing offers a lot of potential for prototyping and custom manufacturing, as it allows for rapid production of complex parts and products. This means that companies can quickly create custom products and parts, without having to invest in expensive tooling. This makes it ideal for companies that need to produce small batches of unique products, or for companies that need to quickly create prototypes for testing. 

In addition, 3D printing can also be used to produce parts and products that are difficult to produce with traditional manufacturing methods. This means that companies can produce complex parts and products that would be impossible to produce with traditional manufacturing methods. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for companies that need to produce complex parts or products.

Ultimately, it's likely that 3D printing will become profitable in niche areas before it takes on mass production. This means that companies should focus on finding ways to use 3D printing to their advantage, whether it be for prototyping, custom manufacturing, or complex parts and products.

Scams and exploits are a part of the gaming landscape, and while they should not be encouraged, it is important that developers like Blizzard take steps to ensure that these activities are not aided by outside software. The best way to do this is to make certain actions impossible within the game, rather than relying on an external team of BanMasters to police the population. This is exactly what Blizzard is doing, and (to my knowledge) what they've always done, and is the best way to ensure that the game remains fair and enjoyable for all players.

Hey everyone, 

I think it's time to discuss the cooldown and warp time in StarCraft. Currently, the cooldown is at 4 seconds and the warp time is at 4 seconds. I think it's time to bump the warp time up to 10 seconds and keep the cooldown as it is. 

The change in warp time would help make the game more strategic and give players more time to think and plan out their strategy. This would also help level the playing field for newer players as they wouldn't be as rushed to make decisions. 

What do you guys think? Should we keep the cooldown as it is and bump the warp time up to 10 seconds?

Unfalsifiable is not a synonym for dismiss-able, it's a synonym for "not science". The anti-SRS movement often claims that scientific evidence is irrelevant to their arguments, and that it can be dismissed because it is "unfalsifiable". This is a fallacy; unfalsifiable does not mean that the evidence can be dismissed, it simply means that it cannot be tested or proven through scientific methods. This is not to say that the evidence is invalid or wrong, but rather that it cannot be proven through scientific means. Therefore, it is important to recognize the difference between unfalsifiable and dismiss-able, and to understand that unfalsifiable does not mean that the evidence can be dismissed.

It's time to take back control and start pleasing myself. I'm done with trying to please my penis. It's time to focus on what I want and need, and to start taking care of myself. From now on, I'm going to focus on my own pleasure and satisfaction. No more trying to please my penis!"

Today I learned that if you're flying, you should always sit behind the wings of the plane in order to increase your chances of survival should the plane crash.

Don't shit where you eat. That's the one piece of financial advice that I've been trying to live by for years. It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you can get away with spending more than you make and that it won't come back to bite you. But it will. Living within your means is the only way to ensure that you don't end up in a financial hole that you can't get out of. So, don't shit where you eat. Live within your means and you'll be able to enjoy the fruits of your labor for years to come.

All in all, CP was an amazing experience and I'm already looking forward to the next one!

Hey everyone,

I recently started talking to a girl I like and I'm trying to figure out the best way to approach her. I saw a few posts on here about ignoring her, flirting back if she initiates, and reading up on sex, but I'm not sure what the best course of action is.

If I ignore her, I'm worried she'll think I'm not interested and never talk to me again. But if I flirt back too much, I'm worried she'll think I'm desperate and not take me seriously.

So what do you guys think? Should I ignore her and wait for her to make the first move? Or should I take the initiative and flirt back? And what about the sex advice? Should I just read up on it and apply it when I'm with her?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

It's funny how people will take a single piece of information, twist it around, and then use it to try and prove a point. It's the classic straw man argument. We've all seen it before; someone takes a point of view, then creates a caricature of that point of view and then proceeds to attack the caricature rather than the actual point of view. It's a logical fallacy and it's not a very effective way to prove your point. If you want to make a convincing argument, make sure you're attacking the actual point of view and not a straw man.

It's easy to get caught up in the grind of daily Guild Wars 2 activities and forget the importance of using your skills to cycle through your atunements. But don't forget that using your skills can save you a lot of time and frustration.

Whether you are farming for gold, crafting materials, or just trying to level up your character, cycling through your atunements can be a great way to maximize your efficiency. It's a simple concept but it can make a big difference. 

By cycling through your atunements, you can quickly switch between different activities without having to stop and switch gear or wait for cooldowns. This can save you a lot of time and help you get more out of your play session.

So don't be bad, use your skills, cycle atunements!

Did I get scammed by Cisco?

I recently purchased a Cisco router from a seller on eBay. The price was very low compared to what it normally costs, so I was suspicious. After I received it, I noticed that it was a refurbished model, and the serial number was different than what was listed on the website. I contacted the seller and they said that the router was genuine, but I'm not sure if I can trust them. Has anyone else had a similar experience with Cisco routers?

I said I had a few that I use for special occasions, like when I want to prank my friends.

The scammer was so confused. He asked me how I got them, and I told him that I had a virus farm, where I breed and raise them. He just hung up after that.

I guess he wasn't expecting to hear something like that. I'm sure he'll think twice before calling me again.

Welcome to r/Guildwars2!

In this post, I wanted to talk about having an identity and philosophy in the game. It's easy to get caught up in the grind of the game, and forget why we're playing in the first place. Having a personal identity and philosophy can help keep you focused and motivated.

Your identity can be anything from a specific class or build, to a particular playstyle, to a specific goal you're working towards. It can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be.

Your philosophy is an attitude you take towards the game. It can be anything from a "play to win" mentality, to a more relaxed and casual approach. Having a philosophy will help you stay focused on why you're playing, and what you're trying to accomplish.

So, take some time to think about what kind of identity and philosophy you want to have in Guild Wars 2. Once you have it, stick to it and make it part of your gaming experience.

Good luck, and have fun!

We need to start investing in renewable energy sources, reduce our carbon footprints, and make sure that we are preserving our natural resources for future generations.

In recent years, the fish farming industry has seen a huge growth in popularity due to its potential to provide a sustainable source of protein. However, despite this, the industry remains relatively small scale compared to other animal farming operations.

This is due to a variety of factors, such as the need for specialized equipment and expertise to set up and maintain a fish farm, as well as the fact that fish farming requires a large amount of space and resources to be successful. Additionally, the cost of the fish feed and other inputs needed to run a successful fish farm can be prohibitively expensive.

Overall, the fish farming industry is still in its infancy and there is potential for it to grow and become more widespread in the future. However, there are still many challenges to overcome before this can happen.

This is a discussion about the recent surge in demand for marijuana in the United States, as well as the implications it has for different social groups. 

It's no secret that the marijuana industry is booming in the US. However, what's often overlooked is the fact that the demand for marijuana is not limited to the stereotypical young and rebellious demographic. In fact, the most recent data suggests that middle aged white dudes are increasingly turning to marijuana to relax after a long day at work. 

This trend has some interesting implications. For one, it helps keep the suburbs looking like suburbs, as the demand for marijuana is no longer limited to the "ghetto", where it is still easy to score a dime bag. This means that the demand for marijuana is more spread out, and no longer concentrated in certain areas. 

At the same time, it also means that these middle aged white dudes are more likely to stockpile marijuana, as they no longer have to worry about running out. This could lead to an increase in prices, as well as a rise in the number of people who are using marijuana. 

Ultimately, this trend is a positive development for the marijuana industry, as it shows that the demand for marijuana is no longer limited to one demographic. Whether or not this trend will continue remains to be seen, but it's clear that the marijuana industry is here to stay.

I feel your pain. It's never fun to be in a bad training environment. I've been in the same boat before and it's no fun.

What you've described is a cancerous, anal-cyst of a training environment. It sounds like a lot of pressure, rules, and expectations that aren't necessary for learning jiu-jitsu. It's important to find a place that is more relaxed and focused on learning.

I'd suggest finding a school with a more chill atmosphere, where the instructors are more focused on teaching technique and having a good time, rather than enforcing a bunch of rules and regulations. Look for a school that emphasizes technique, learning, and having fun.

I think Tron is an awesome movie, but it really depends on who you are and what you're looking for in a movie. I personally love the visuals, the soundtrack, and the overall story. However, some people might find it too slow or too sci-fi. 

If you're considering watching Tron, it's important to think about what you're looking for in a movie. Are you looking for a movie with a lot of action? Or are you looking for something more thought-provoking? Are you looking for something that will make you think, or something that will make you laugh? 

No matter what you're looking for, Tron is definitely worth considering. It's a classic movie that has stood the test of time, and it's still as entertaining as it was when it first came out.

It's true that learning the game of Dota 2 will help you to learn the heroes naturally, as you will understand the mechanics and strategies of the game better. However, there are some heroes that require a different kind of skill to play, which is micro-intensive. These heroes require quick decision making, faster reflexes, and a better understanding of how the hero works in order to be successful. So, while learning the game will help you with most heroes, there are some that require a different kind of skill to be successful.

Japan has been an economic powerhouse for decades, but it seems that the country has been getting lazy lately. With the rise of other Asian countries such as China and South Korea, Japan is facing more competition than ever before.

The government has been trying to stimulate the economy, but it seems that the country is still struggling to keep up with the rest of the world.

It's not often that we hear about how easy it is to establish identity in the UK. But, it is true. Establishing identity is an incredibly simple process, and if there's any doubt then you'll be arrested.

It's important to remember that the police and other authorities have the power to ask for proof of identity at any time. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to investigate a crime or to ensure that someone is who they say they are. In order to establish identity, you will need to provide documents such as a valid passport, driving licence, or birth certificate.

It's also important to note that if you fail to provide proof of identity when asked, you can be arrested. The police have the power to arrest someone who they believe is not who they say they are. So, it's always important to have your identity documents with you at all times.

I was walking around the city when I saw this incredible sight. A fat person was walking down the street, but then I noticed something strange. There was a smaller person coming out of the fat person's stomach! It was like something out of a movie. 

I couldn't believe my eyes. I watched as the smaller person emerged from the fat person's stomach and started running away. I was amazed at how this small person had managed to fight its way out of the fat person's stomach. 

It was a truly remarkable sight and I'm glad I got to witness it. I'm sure this small person will have a great story to tell when it reaches its destination.

I'm a tech support analyst and I'm usually pretty good at my job, but late at night I often find myself acting like I'm high or something. I'll be typing out responses to customers, trying to help them with their technical issues, and then I'll suddenly start typing random gibberish or making up words. It's like my brain just shuts off and I'm just typing out whatever comes to mind. It's really embarrassing, but it's also kind of funny. I'm glad no one else is around to see it!

Hey everyone,

I'm a Zerg player and I'm trying to figure out the best way to defend against air attacks. I know that investing in Queens and Overseers is the best way to get anti-air defense, but it can be expensive and you don't always have the resources. On the other hand, making 3+ Spores can provide a good defense against air attacks, but it can be hard to cover all of your tech buildings, bases and drones.

So my question is, what do you think is the best way to defend against air attacks? Do you invest in Queens and Overseers or do you make 3+ Spores to cover all of your tech buildings, bases and drones?

Thanks for your help!

I'm sure many of us have had experiences where we're out with someone and the bill comes and the question of who's going to pay arises. In my experience, the default expectation is that the asker pays. I think this is unfair and that going dutch should be the default. By making it clear up front, it helps avoid any potential problems. I understand that this puts the responsibility on the asker, which may be unfair, but it's the only way to ensure that the default expectation is to go dutch. 

My ideal situation is that the majority of people expect to go dutch when out with someone. I'm not sure how to get there, but I think it's an important goal that we should work towards.

"We live in a world full of uncertainty, and it can be hard to make sense of it all. Too often, we focus on the little things that don't really matter in the grand scheme of things. We get caught up in debates about religion, politics, and other divisive issues, when really, these things don't have a huge impact on our lives.

So instead of focusing on the things that divide us, we should be asking ourselves the bigger questions. What is our purpose? What can we do to make the world a better place? What can we do to be better people?

These are the questions that will help us to find meaning and purpose in our lives, and to make a real difference in the world. So let's start asking ourselves the important questions, my friend!"
|


Stop worrying about the things in life that have no answer and start worrying about the things that do. Life is too short to spend time worrying about things that don't have an answer. Focus your energy on the things that you can change and make a difference in. Take control of your life and make it the best it can be. Don't get bogged down in the things that you can't control or answer. Life is too short to waste it worrying about things that don't matter.

Hey everyone!

I recently watched a video that really inspired me and I wanted to share it with the r/gamedev community. The video is about finding a driving principle in life, no matter what field you are in. It encourages us to find something we believe in and do something to make a positive change in the world. 

This video is a great reminder that we all have the power to make a difference. Even if you are just starting out in the game development industry, you can still make a difference. We can all use our skills and passions to create something that makes a positive impact on the world. 

So, let's all take a moment to think about what we believe in and how we can use our talents to make a difference. What can you do to make a positive change in the world?

Thanks for reading, and I hope this video inspired you as much as it did me.

What's the best topping for a hot dog?

This is a classic debate with no one definitive answer. Some people prefer mustard and ketchup, while others go for chili and cheese. Some like to get creative with a variety of condiments and toppings like sauerkraut, relish, onions, jalapenos, bacon, and even peanut butter! So, what's your favorite topping for a hot dog?

We've all heard of EVE Online, the massive sandbox MMO that has some of the most epic battles in gaming. But don't expect to see battles anywhere near the scale you see in EVE in other games. While other games may have large-scale battles, they pale in comparison to the massive battles that EVE can offer. The sheer number of players, ships, and other assets that can be involved in a single battle in EVE is staggering. Even if a game were to attempt to replicate the scale of battles in EVE, it would be difficult to capture the same intensity and complexity. So while other games may have large-scale battles, they won't be able to match the scale and intensity of those in EVE.

It's becoming increasingly clear that the Republican party is no longer a party of patriotism and loyalty to the United States. Instead, they have become a party of obstruction, lies, and treason. It's no longer enough to disagree with the other side; they are actively working against the interests of the American people. From their refusal to pass legislation that would help the economy, to their attempts to undermine our democracy, it's clear that the Republican party is no longer loyal to the United States. They are traitors to the Constitution and to the American people.

I was driving home from work the other day and I stopped at a red light. All of a sudden, I hear a voice coming from the car next to me. It was a police officer singing along to a song on the radio. I couldn't help but join in and before I knew it, we were singing a duet together! It was so unexpected and I was a bit embarrassed, but it was also pretty awesome. I had to tell Reddit about it!

I recently got caught driving without car insurance for two years. I was expecting a hefty fine of $2000-$10,000 and/or 30 days in jail, but instead, I was let go with a warning.

I'm thankful for the officer's mercy and will never drive without insurance again.

I'm an emotional person, and I'm not afraid to show it. I'm not ashamed of my feelings or my thoughts, and I'm not afraid to express them. I'm the kind of person that will wear my emotions on my sleeve and be open about them. I'm not afraid to ramble on and on about the things that I'm feeling and the thoughts that I'm having. I'm not afraid to be honest about my feelings and share them with others. I'm not afraid to be vulnerable and express myself in a way that may not be popular or accepted by everyone. That's just who I am, and I'm not going to apologize for it.

It's a shame that Riot had to take such a harsh stance against Frost, but at the same time they did break the rules. I think Riot should have had booths at the event, like they do at LCS events, where they could have talked to the players and given them a warning or punishment. This would have been a much better way to handle the situation rather than just banning them outright. I understand that Riot wants to be taken seriously, but I think this was a little too extreme.

This article is a prime example of how some people can be so insular and condescending to those who don't agree with them. It's a biased article, and yet the author acts as if it isn't, as if his opinion is the only one that matters. It's incredibly disrespectful to those who don't agree with him and it does nothing to contribute to the conversation, except for insults. It's really sad to see people act in such an entitled manner.

"It's been a few months since the SRS brigade targeted the Torchlight subreddit, and it's been a relief to see the removal of inappropriate submissions. We recently recruited a new mod to help us with the task of keeping the subreddit clean, and we're pleased to say that he has been doing a great job.

This is a great question! 

Fat and water don't bond in the same way that oil and water don't. Fat is a hydrophobic molecule, meaning it repels water. This is why fat and water don't mix and why they separate when they are combined. This is also why you can't make a sauce with just fat and water.

However, fat can be emulsified with water, meaning it can be suspended in water in the form of tiny droplets. This is done through the addition of emulsifiers such as lecithin or egg yolks. These emulsifiers work by coating the fat droplets and preventing them from clumping together. This allows the fat to be suspended in the water, creating a creamy sauce or dressing. 

Hope this helps!

I'm trying to branch out and learn more about the paleo lifestyle, and I've found a lot of interesting podcasts online. The problem is that I always read the summary of the podcast and then decide whether or not to listen to it based on that. I know that this isn't the best way to go about it, and I really need to listen to the podcasts and not judge it based on the quick summary. Does anyone have any tips or tricks for making sure that I'm actually listening to the podcasts and not just skimming through the summaries?

Hey everyone,

I'm sure we can all agree that learning is good. Whether it's learning a new instrument, a new technique, or just brushing up on some music theory, learning is always beneficial. It can help us become better musicians, and it can also help us become better people.

Learning can open our eyes to new ideas, new cultures, and new ways of thinking. It can help us become more well-rounded in our understanding of the world, and it can help us become more creative in our music.

Upsampling and downsampling are two important concepts in digital audio production. Upsampling does nothing to the audio, it simply increases the sample rate of the audio file. Downsampling, on the other hand, reduces the sample rate of the audio file which can create quantization errors. To avoid these errors, it is important to use a process called dithering. Dithering helps to reduce the audible artifacts of quantization errors and is an important part of audio production. I highly recommend reading the Izotope Ozone manual to learn more about dithering and how to use it properly in your productions. The Izotope Ozone manual is full of great information and is a great resource for anyone looking to learn more about audio production.

What advice would you give to someone who is attending classes for the first time?

I'm sure many of us have been there before - attending classes for the first time can be a daunting experience. Here are some tips I've picked up over the years that have helped me make the most out of my classes:

1. Show up on time - Arriving to class on time shows respect for your professor and your classmates, and will make it much easier to stay engaged in the lecture.

2. Take notes - Taking notes during class is a great way to stay focused and organized. It also helps you retain information more effectively.

3. Ask questions - Don't be afraid to ask questions during class. Asking questions is a great way to get clarification on topics you don't understand and to get to know your professor better.

4. Participate in discussions - Participating in class discussions is a great way to get to know your classmates and to practice your communication skills.

5. Stay organized - Staying organized is key to success in classes. Make sure to keep track of due dates, assignments, and other important information.

Following these tips will help you make the most out of your classes and ensure that you get the most out of your education. Good luck!

It's a pretty common thing that nationalitys are pointed out in Germany. I don't like it myself, but it's what most other nationalitys living in Germany demand. It's not just the Germans that do this, but other nationalitys as well. It's a sign of respect, but it can also be seen as a way of segregating people.

I think it's important that we all respect each other regardless of our nationalitys, and that we don't make assumptions about someone based on their nationality. We should all be able to get along and appreciate the diversity that living in Germany brings.

Hey everyone,

I'm sure many of us have been in situations where we felt like we had to force a relationship to work. Whether it be a romantic relationship or a friendship, it can be really exhausting to try and make something work that just isn't there.

My advice is to focus on forming real friendships with people and let nature take its course. If it turns into something more, great! But if it doesn't, you still have a great friend.

It's so much easier to be yourself and let things happen naturally. Don't force a relationship, just let it happen.

I disagree, I think not only was Moffat a better writer but also a better showrunner than RTD. While RTD had some great ideas, Moffat was able to bring them to life in a way that was more engaging and exciting. He was able to craft more complex and interesting stories, and he was able to take risks that RTD was unwilling to take. His run on Doctor Who was far more experimental and creative, and it showed in the quality of the show. He was also able to bring out the best in the actors, creating some truly iconic performances. All in all, I think Moffat was a far better showrunner than RTD, and I believe that his run on Doctor Who will be remembered as one of the best.

As a show runner, one should be willing to take risks and make bold decisions, even if it means killing off a beloved character. They should also know how to keep secrets and be able to maintain the suspense and mystery of a story without spoiling it for the audience. Lastly, the show runner should be telling the best story possible, regardless of where it takes them. It's important to stay true to the story and not be afraid to take risks. It's all about creating a captivating and engaging story that keeps viewers coming back for more.

It's true, Jester doesn't understand FW mechanics worth a damn. I've seen him try to explain how to set up a mission or how to join a militia, and it's clear he has no clue. He's been playing for years, and he still doesn't understand the basics. It's really quite sad.

What's worse is that he doesn't even realize how little he knows. He'll try to give advice to new players and completely mess them up. I've had to step in and correct him more than once.

If you're a new player, don't take advice from Jester. He doesn't understand the game, and he'll just make things worse.

Hey everyone,

I'm sure most of us have heard the phrase "opposites attract," but I'm wondering if there is any truth to it when it comes to relationships. I'm a firm believer that goals, dreams and personal values are pretty critical components of a relationship.

Do you think it's important to have similar goals and values in order to have a successful relationship? Or do you think that having different goals and values can bring something unique to the table?

I recently heard about a friend of mine who decided to put 500k into a penny stock. He was told it was mathematically feasible, but very unlikely to work in his favor. After a few weeks, he was shocked to find out that the stock had gone up significantly, and he had made a decent profit on his investment.

This story is a great example of why it's important to be careful when investing in penny stocks. While they may have the potential to make you a lot of money, they can also be incredibly risky. If you're considering investing in penny stocks, make sure you do your research and understand the risks before you put your money on the line.

It's no secret that the financial crisis of 2008 was caused by a number of factors. One of the biggest contributing factors was the refusal to regulate derivatives such as credit default swaps, which played a significant role in the crisis. Additionally, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act also allowed for the risky investments that caused the crisis. Contrary to popular belief, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were actually some of the safest institutions in the market.

Despite the severity of the crisis, the recovery has actually been fairly robust. The reason why the recovery hasn't been stronger is mostly due to the actions of Republicans in Congress, state legislatures, and local legislatures. These lawmakers have consistently blocked measures that would help stimulate the economy and create jobs, which has hindered the recovery.

I don't know about you, but if I can manage to keep from getting sick from chewing on my pen after having scratched my ass or balls with my writing hand a few times, then I'm pretty sure that NFL players will have no problem.

So if the players are washing their hands and using a little saliva to wipe down their equipment, they should be just fine.

Hello everyone!

I've been a long time fan of the Football Manager series and have had some great experiences with it. I'm looking for some updates on how good/in-depth this version is so I can decide if I want to get involved with another FM campaign.

I've always enjoyed the challenge of managing a club and taking them from the lower divisions to the top of the league. I find the tactical side of the game to be the most enjoyable and challenging part, and I also like to tinker with the player transfers.

I'm interested to hear from people who have played the latest version and whether it is still as good as previous versions. I'm also interested to hear about any new features or improvements that have been made.

Thanks in advance for any advice and opinions!

As someone with a degree in Computer Science and a Software Engineering internship under my belt, I highly recommend either CS or SE as more suitable degrees for aspiring game developers. Not only will they teach you the technical skills needed to develop games, but they will also give you a better understanding of the industry and the development process. Additionally, I highly recommend getting an internship. It will give you invaluable experience and help you stand out from the crowd when applying for jobs. Good luck!

I recently bought a set of gear from the auction house in Diablo 3. I was expecting it to be a good set, but it turns out that it can be beaten quite handily by the gear I can find in the game. It was really expensive too, so it's really disappointing. Has anyone else experienced this?

If you're lucky, you'll get a rough until the heat syncs. Second question: would it damage the hardware? In moderation, probably not. Water is not inherently bad for electronics. Pure water is a very poor conductor, and it's usually the salts and other dissolved minerals in water that damage electronics. Since most of the water in your dry-ice produced mist came from the air, it's relatively pure. There also isn't much of it: again, most of it came out of the air and there isn't much water vapor in the air to begin with. (Very little water comes from the dry ice's water supply because cold water doesn't evaporate well. The water level will drop because the ice sublimated.) Some of the water will condense inside of the case, but for a short time not enough that it should cause major problems. I say probably because computers can handle humidity pretty well, but don't expect the warranty to cover you if something goes wrong.

Nobody knows who you are, and that's why we have to protect the organization. As a student, faculty, or staff member at Middle Tennessee State University, it is our responsibility to ensure that the university remains a safe and secure environment for everyone. This means that we must be aware of our own actions and the actions of those around us. We must be mindful of our words and our behavior, and we must be respectful of each other. We must also take steps to protect the university's resources, such as its physical property and its digital information. By doing so, we can help ensure that MTSU will remain a safe and secure place for everyone.

Ah, the college football season is nearly over and the playoff is just around the corner. I can't wait to see who will be crowned national champion! It's been an exciting season and I'm sure the playoff will be even better. Who do you think will come out on top? Let's hear your predictions! #CFBPlayoff #CollegeFootball

Hey everyone! I'm feeling pretty tired, but I know I should be doing some work on my Kerbal Space Program projects. I'm feeling lazy and I figure people can figure out what I'm doing by watching one of my launches, but I know I should be putting in the extra effort to make sure everything is running smoothly. See you in space!

Hey everyone!

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I recently got an Xbox 360 and I'm wondering if I need to install some kind of anti-virus software on it. I'm not sure if it's necessary, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.

Thanks in advance for any advice!

I recently started a new habit of donating all of the contents of a plastic storage tub every year. I have a few plastic bins in my closet that I use for storage, and every year when I clean out my closet I empty the contents of one of them into a pile. I then proceed to go through each item and decide what I want to keep and what I want to donate. It's a great way to stay organized and make sure I'm not hoarding things I don't need. I'm also able to donate items that are still in good condition to those in need. It's a win-win situation and I'm glad I started this habit.

You're a fucking idiot, lol. But seriously, minimalism is a great way to simplify your life and get rid of the excess stuff that's weighing you down. It's about focusing on what you need and getting rid of what you don't. It's about learning to be content with what you have and not being focused on accumulating more and more stuff. So, if you want to get rid of the clutter and stress in your life, minimalism is a great way to do it.

Hey everyone!

I recently had a long discussion with an economics grad about the Magic: The Gathering card market, and he confirmed to me that the market will hit 60-70 before it will slowly start to creep up again.

He said that the market is cyclical, and it will always dip low before it starts to climb up again. He also said that this is a natural process and it’s something we have to accept.

I hope this info helps some of you out there who are worried about the current state of the market. Good luck to all of you!

I'm a crossdresser, and I'm constantly looking for ways to feel more content with myself. I know that there are some home supplements that can help with minor changes and full transitions, but I want to make sure I'm doing things right. /r/asktransgender is a great place to get advice and information on this topic, and I urge anyone considering taking any kind of supplement to read up and get the facts before they do anything that could do more harm than good. 

EDIT: Also, I'm pretty certain that the directions for taking estrogen supplements are geared towards female biochemistry, and would not show the correct dosage for a male to take. So if you're male and considering taking estrogen supplements, please be sure to get the right information before you do.

Hey everyone.

I'm still on adderall, but I wanted to share something that has been helping me through my addiction. It's called Jesus Christ.

I know it sounds crazy, but I've found that praying to Jesus and reading the Bible helps me stay focused on my recovery. It gives me strength and hope in times of weakness and despair.

I hope this helps someone else out there who is struggling with addiction. God bless.

It all depends on your climate, soil type, and the types of plants you want to grow. If you live in a cold climate, you may need to focus on hardy plants that can survive the winter. If you live in a warm climate, you may be able to grow a wider variety of plants. In terms of soil type, you'll want to make sure you have the right balance of nutrients for the types of plants you want to grow. Finally, you'll need to do some research on the types of plants that you want to grow and make sure you understand the requirements for those plants. With a little bit of research and planning, you can create a beautiful garden that will thrive in your climate and soil type.

Hey everyone,

I recently read an article about the Boy Scouts of America's decision to allow gay men to be scout leaders and it got me thinking about the statistics behind it. According to research, gay men are actually less likely to commit sexual abuse than heterosexual men. This means that gay men should totally be allowed to be scout leaders.

I know that some people have religious and moral objections to this decision, but the facts are clear. Gay men are not a threat to the safety of scouts, and they should be allowed to participate in the organization.

What do you all think? Do you agree with the decision to allow gay men to be scout leaders?
|


Chicagoans,

As you may know, Illinois law requires scout leaders to be mandated reporters and to report any suspected child abuse or neglect to the authorities. This means that if a scout leader suspects that a child is being abused or neglected, they must report it to the proper authorities.

It is our responsibility as citizens of this great state to ensure that our children are safe and protected. If you have any information about a child who may be in danger, please do not hesitate to report it. Together, we can make sure that our children are kept safe and that those who are responsible for their care are held accountable.

Thank you for helping to keep our children safe.

Sincerely,

The Reddit Community of Chicago

This past summer, I had the unfortunate experience of having to deal with a 16 year old kid with the mindset of the Joker. On a scouting trip, he decided to take off all his clothes and wander around the campsite. He then proceeded to hump the leader of the troop, which caused the entire troop to crumble. 

It was a difficult situation to handle, as we had to make sure the kid was safe, while also ensuring the other kids weren't exposed to any inappropriate behavior. In the end, the kid was removed from the troop and sent home. 

This is a reminder of how important it is to be aware of the mental health of the youth in our troops, and to be prepared to handle any difficult situations that may arise.

Hey everyone,

I know there's been a lot of talk about how Brand is overpowered in the current meta, but I wanted to take a moment to say that I think he's actually in a pretty good spot. I've been playing him a lot lately and I find that he is manageable and not too difficult to deal with in team fights.

The biggest issue I have seen is that people don't build the right items to counter him, which can lead to some frustrating games. But overall, I think Brand is fine and doesn't need any major nerfs or buffs.

What do you guys think?

It's snack time in the office, and the team is debating who to pick for the next game of GI Joe vs. Cobra. I'm standing in the corner, watching the debate, and I can't help but think that everyone should always pick GI Joe. Why? Because apparently when you pick Cobra, you aren't worthy of cookies at snack time. 

So, if you want to get your hands on those delicious treats, always pick GI Joe. Trust me, it's worth it.

I'm in a league play human vs human in EA NHL and it's been a great experience so far. We have a policy to weed out people who disappear or don't show up to their games, which has been really helpful in keeping the league active and competitive. Most of the GMs in the league are really dedicated and take their games seriously, which makes for some great matches. 

If you're looking for a fun, competitive league to join, I would definitely recommend this one!

It's been a long and emotional ride for the Islanders and their fans as they prepare to bid farewell to the Nassau Coliseum. After years of ups and downs, the Islanders will finally be making their move to Brooklyn.

Tonight marks the final game at the Coliseum and it's sure to be an emotional one. As the Islanders take the ice for the last time, it's hard to not feel a twinge of sadness for all the memories that have been made here.

But as the Islanders embark on their new journey, it's time to look ahead and start a new chapter. So, let's go Islanders! WHERE BROOKLYN AT?!

Hey everyone!

I recently ran a game where I allowed my players to steal ideas from different noncommercial IPs. It was a great experience and I had a lot of fun with it. However, I did notice that the players almost certainly derailed the plot because of it.

So, if you're considering allowing your players to steal ideas from noncommercial IPs, just be aware that the players almost certainly will derail the plot. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's something to be aware of.

What has been your experience with allowing players to steal from noncommercial IPs?

Hey everyone!

I've been playing Pathfinder for a few months now, and I'm starting to get a bit of a handle on the rules. I'm still a bit of a noob, though, so I thought I'd come here and ramble a bit about my experiences with the game.

I'm playing a Half-Elf Rogue in a 3-player game, and it's been a lot of fun. I'm really enjoying the flexibility of the class, and the ability to do a lot of different things. I'm also really liking the tactical elements of the game, and the way it encourages you to think about your character and their capabilities in a different way than other RPGs.

Overall, I'm really enjoying Pathfinder, and I'm looking forward to learning more about the rules and the game. Thanks for reading my ramble!

"It's so true. I remember when the internet was a wild place full of creativity and interesting conversations. Now it's just full of people trying to be cool, or trying to show off how 'unique' they are.

What happened to the days when people were actually creating something new and interesting?"

Hey everyone, 

I recently beat Nugget Bridge with a level 50 Charmander and I was wondering if I could get Mew or Mewtwo as a starter Pokémon. Has anyone else done this? If so, what did you get? I'm really curious to know if I can get a legendary Pokémon as a starter. 

Thanks for any help!

My cousin convinced me that a level 100 Pokemon would die if I kept playing, so I deleted my save file. I had put so much time and effort into my game, and now it's all gone. I'm so angry and frustrated right now. Has anyone else had a similar experience?
|


I've been playing Pokemon games since I was a kid and I've always had a group of friends who were also into it. We would all hack the games, play them a lot, and try to beat each other. But no matter how much we played, we never could beat each other. We never cheated either, we just enjoyed the challenge of the games. It was a lot of fun and it's something I still look back on fondly.

I recently traveled to a country that is notorious for its strict laws. I was expecting to be stopped and questioned by the police, but I was pleasantly surprised. People would look at me, but I never felt like I was in any danger. I think the key is to be respectful and to not draw attention to yourself. I'm sure there are places in the world where you may get into trouble, but if you do your research and take the necessary precautions, you should have a safe and enjoyable trip.

"So I was at the store the other day, and I saw this old man with a cane. He was struggling to get his groceries onto the checkout counter, so I offered to help him. He thanked me and said, 'That's very kind of you, young man. That said, good story.'

I was so confused, so I asked him what he meant. He said, 'I don't know, it's just something my grandpa used to say when something nice happened. He'd say 'That said, good story.' I guess it just stuck with me.'

I thought it was a really sweet sentiment, so I thanked him again and wished him a good day. I'm still not sure what he meant, but I like to think it's a reminder to appreciate the good moments in life."

This is a difficult topic, and it's one that I see a lot of people struggling with. It's not easy to find someone who is compatible with you, and it's even harder to find someone who is willing to have sex with you. But, it is possible.

The first step is to go online and find a girl that matches you. This could mean using a dating site, or it could mean going out and meeting people in person. Either way, make sure you get to know the person before you start anything physical.

Once you've found someone who you think is compatible with you, it's time to own who you are. Don't try to be someone you're not, be honest about who you are, and be proud of it. This is the best way to show someone that you're confident and that you know what you want.

Once you've done that, it's time to impress the girl with your you-ness. Show her that you know who you are and that you're comfortable in your own skin. Show her that you're not afraid to be yourself, and that you're willing to take risks.

Once you've done all of that, it's time to have sex with her, if she wants to have sex with you. This is a very personal decision, and it should be respected. Make sure that you both feel comfortable and that you both trust each other.

In the end, it's all about finding someone who is compatible with you, owning who you are, and being confident in yourself. If you can do all of that, then you can find someone who is willing to have sex with you. Good luck!

She is really smart. Not only is she beautiful, but she is also incredibly intelligent. She is always looking for ways to better herself and her knowledge, and it's inspiring to see. She's not afraid to take on new challenges and is always up for a good debate. She's a great friend and an even better person.

You are an uninformed shit head if you think that college football is just about the players and coaches. College football is so much more than that. It's about the fans, the traditions, the rivalries, and the history. It's about the pageantry and the excitement that comes with every game. It's about the passion and dedication that goes into every play. College football is so much more than just a game. It's a culture and a lifestyle that has been around for generations. So don't be a shit head and think college football is just about the players and coaches. It's so much more than that.

This post is in response to an article from The Economist that discussed the progress made in South Africa since the end of apartheid.

It seems like the author of the article failed to recognize the fact that freedom means something different to South African blacks than it does to other people. To SA blacks, freedom isn't just about having the same rights as everyone else, it's about being able to take part in a society that has been historically oppressive. It's about being able to live without fear of discrimination and violence.

The Economist should have done a better job of informing readers about this important cultural perspective. It's not enough to just talk about the progress that has been made; we must also recognize the cultural context in which that progress has been made. Otherwise, we risk overlooking the struggles that SA blacks still face.

2008 was my first time voting in a Presidential election, and I cast my vote for Barack Obama. This year, my vote is primarily a vote against Obama, rather than for Mitt Romney. However, there is one aspect of Romney that I do quite like: I think he will do much better at handling the economy. While I don't agree with all of his fiscal policies, I believe that his business acumen, combined with his experience in the private sector, will be beneficial for the nation's economy.

Hey everyone,

I'm a woman and I'm interested in MRA (Men's Rights Activism). I don't really understand it myself and I've never had a conversion moment, but I'm still interested in it.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who's interested in MRA but doesn't really get it. I'm curious to hear why other people are interested in it and how they got into it.

Thanks!

Men are not predominantly to blame for the system that allows women to behave badly. This system is the result of a complex web of gender roles, societal expectations, and institutionalized sexism. 

Primary female lobby groups and public opinion have created a culture in which women are not held accountable for their behavior. Women are not expected to take responsibility for their actions, and are often given a pass when they do something wrong. This culture has been perpetuated by the media, which often portrays women as victims and men as aggressors. 

The reality is that men and women are both responsible for the systems that allow women to behave badly. Men must speak out against this system, and hold women accountable for their actions. We must also work to create a culture of respect and equality, one in which women are held to the same standards as men. Only then can we create a society in which everyone is treated equally.

We've all seen it: two people arguing over something incredibly trivial, and it escalating to the point of physical violence. It's a sad sight, but even more tragic is when it ends in someone's death. 

No matter how trivial the argument may have been, death is never a good outcome. In such situations, it's important to remember that breaking up the fight or walking away doesn't make you a "pansy-ass". It takes courage and strength to step in and stop the fight, or to simply walk away. 

It's important to remember that no matter how minor an argument may be, it can still have deadly consequences. So before things get out of hand, take a step back and think about the potential consequences of the situation. 

Be the bigger person, and don't let a fight escalate to the point of tragedy.

This is a sad but true story about a scam that targeted "highly educated" Americans. It seems that those with higher education levels were more likely to fall for this scam because of their lack of knowledge about the financial system and their trust in the people running it. 

The scam was a Ponzi scheme that promised high returns on investments. It seemed too good to be true, and it was. The people running the scheme were able to take advantage of the trust of the "highly educated" Americans and scam them out of their money. 

It's a reminder that no matter how smart or educated you are, you should always be aware of potential scams and never trust someone blindly. It's also a reminder that no matter how smart you are, you can still be fooled.

As a long-time fan of the Halo series, I have to admit that the books and games don't really match up. With the release of Halo Reach, it's become even more obvious that the books and games don't line up. While they may have some similarities, the games and books have taken different paths and tell different stories. It's not an easy answer as to which one is the "true" story; both are valid interpretations of the Halo universe.
|


It's true that there are people who are uneducated, ignorant, and stereotypical on both sides of the fence, but it's important to remember that it's not just an American problem. There are people all around the world who don't think about other humans and act on their own selfish desires. It's easy to point the finger at the United States and blame them for everything, but it's important to remember that we are all responsible for our own actions. Islam teaches us to be kind and compassionate to others, no matter their race, religion, or nationality. We must strive to be better and to treat others with respect and understanding.

He's a phony! A big, fat phony! I was so excited when I heard about the new Zelda game, but after playing it I realized it was nothing like the classic Zelda games I used to love. The graphics were terrible, the controls were clunky, and the story was shallow. It felt like a cheap knock-off of the real thing. I'm disappointed and I'm not sure if I'll ever try another Zelda game again.

Verizon is one of the biggest telecom companies in the world, but they don't have the best reputation when it comes to customer service. They have been known to have terrible customer service, high prices, and poor network coverage. Despite all this, they still have a large customer base in Orlando. 

I have personally had terrible experiences with Verizon, and I have heard similar stories from many others. They are not a company I would ever recommend to anyone. So while they may not be left out in the cold based on technology, I still think they should be avoided.

"Most of the points probably don't matter that much.  Get what better suites your needs. 

For example, if you're looking for a new car, don't worry about the color of the interior or the type of alloy wheels. Just get the one that has the features and reliability you need. 

The same goes for other things in life. Don't get caught up in the details, just get what works for you."

"I was in the Apple store the other day and overheard a customer asking for the best laptop for gaming. The salesperson recommended an iMac and the customer was taken aback. He said, 'I don't want an iMac, I want a laptop!' The salesperson replied, 'Well, the casing is VERY important for most people. Also, a crappy TN LCD doesn't cut it anymore, the screen iMac's have is not a cheap TN.'

I had to stifle a laugh. The customer probably thought the salesperson was crazy, but the truth is that the iMac is actually a great machine for gaming. So, if you're looking for a laptop for gaming and don't want to sacrifice on quality, then an iMac might be the way to go!"

It's not the frivolous surface vandals like this that make Wikipedia's content less than trustworthy; it's the people who edit seriously and do so with either careless or disingenuous source usage.

It's exciting to think about what new features we could see in the remakes, and I'm sure we'll all be pleasantly surprised when the games come out.

Australia has long been a leader in refugee resettlement, taking in 80,000 refugees a year on a permanent basis. This is a remarkable achievement, especially when compared to other countries. 

Unfortunately, many of these refugees come from refugee camps, which are often overcrowded and lack basic amenities. It is a testament to the compassion of the Australian people that they are willing to take in such large numbers of refugees. 

However, the worst choice for refugees is to risk their lives on boats, as many have done in the past. The risk of death in a boat accident is too great, and other countries should strive to do more to provide safe and secure resettlement for refugees. 

Australia is setting an example that other countries should follow. We should all be doing our part to ensure that refugees are given the chance to rebuild their lives in safety.

Hey everyone, 

I'm sure many of you have been in the same position as me: wanting to find someone special to settle down with, but not knowing where to start. Well, I'm here to tell you that the best way to find the right person is to date around. Don't be afraid to go on dates with different people and explore different relationships. You never know who you might find, and you never know what kind of connection you might make. 

So don't be afraid to date around and take your time. You don't have to settle down with the first person you meet. Keep your options open and explore different relationships. Who knows, you might just find the one you want to settle down with! 

Good luck everyone!

Hi everyone!

I'm a real estate salesperson and I wanted to share some advice for anyone looking to get into the industry.

First and foremost, if you're serious about getting into real estate, you should have a savings of at least $10 000 in case you struggle in your first year. This will give you a cushion in case you don't make as much money as you'd like in the beginning.

Second, make sure you study a lot and stay educated. The real estate industry is constantly changing and you need to stay ahead of the game.

Third, work hard. It's not easy to be successful in real estate, but if you put in the effort, you can make it.

Finally, don't be afraid to grab the bull by the horns. Nothing extraordinary in life happens by people who play it safe. Take risks and make moves to get ahead.

I hope this advice helps anyone looking to get into real estate. Good luck!

Hey everyone!

I'm here to share a lesson I learned the hard way - never assume someone's cool with a nickname.

When I was in high school, I had a friend who I thought was really cool and I wanted to give them a nickname. I thought it was funny and clever, but it turns out they didn't like it at all. They felt like I was belittling them with the nickname, and it caused a lot of tension between us.

It was a tough lesson to learn, but it taught me to never assume that someone is okay with a nickname. It's always better to ask first and make sure they're comfortable with it.

Thanks for reading. :)

I recently had a 1v1 as Soraka vs Xin Zhao and I managed to outplay him pretty hard. After the game he said to me: "You were right, Soraka is pretty strong against Xin". I was really surprised to hear that from him, but it just goes to show that even if you don't play a champion very often, you can still use it to your advantage. It's all about understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the champions and utilizing them to your advantage.

"So my buddy and I were over at his dad's place the other day and we noticed a really strong smell coming from his room. We asked him what it was and he said it was nothing, but we knew it was something. We decided to investigate and found out his dad had been blazin' the dankest of the dank! We were so surprised and couldn't help but laugh. We had a great time that day, and it was even better knowing that his dad was a stoner too! #trees"

Hello all,

I'm a web developer looking to get more involved in the local tech community. I've been attending a few meetups here and there and connecting with other developers, but I'm looking for more opportunities to network with small companies. 

Even if they don't have any immediate need for my services, I'm hoping to establish a relationship with them and learn more about the industry. I'm sure I can develop other connections, such as referrals and other job opportunities, by networking with small companies.

Has anyone else had any success networking with small companies? What tips do you have for making the most of such connections?

Thanks!

Giving one player the absolute most fun possible isn't the design goal for good game designers.

Good game designers strive to create a game that is enjoyable for all players, even if that means that the individual's experience may not be the most exciting. The goal is to create a game that is balanced, fair and engaging for everyone. A good game designer will take into account the different playstyles and skill levels of all players, and create a game that is enjoyable for all.

A game that caters to one individual's needs may not be as enjoyable for the rest of the players, so a game designer must take into account the whole player base. This means creating a game that offers a variety of challenges, rewards and strategies that appeal to different types of players.

Ultimately, a good game designer will create a game that is fun and engaging for everyone, rather than just one player.

Go fuck yourself. Life is too short to waste time on people who don't appreciate you. Move on and find people who do. Life is too short to stay stuck in the same place. Take a chance and explore the world. Don't let anyone hold you back.

I used to be a strong carnivore and I'd never have given veganism a second thought. But after spending some time here on r/vegan, I've started to realize that maybe I should give veganism a try. I've been reading up on it and watching documentaries and it's starting to make more and more sense. I'm still a little bit skeptical, but I'm willing to give it a chance. Congratulations to me, I guess! I'm starting my journey towards veganism and I'm excited to see where it takes me. Thanks to everyone here who has helped me get started, I really appreciate it.

Hey everyone! 

I'm new to NoFap, and I'm really excited to get started on this journey. I'm looking for some advice from the experienced members here. What tips do you have for someone just starting out? What helped you the most when you first started NoFap? 

I'm also wondering if there are any other resources or support groups I should check out to help me stay motivated. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I recently went on a solo trip to a Middle East country, and I decided to hitchhike from one city to the next. I got into a car with an older male driver who seemed nice enough at first, but he kept getting more and more inappropriate. He kept touching my knee, and he kept making lewd comments about my body. I was so uncomfortable and scared, but I didn't want to make a scene and get out of the car. I eventually made it to my destination, but it was a really unpleasant experience. Has anyone else had a similar experience? What did you do?

It's amazing how often I see people try to push their conspiracy theories on this sub without doing even the most basic research to see if their story has any facts to back it up. 

I recently saw a post that claimed that a certain company was owned by Monsanto, but the poster hadn't even bothered to check if the people they listed actually worked for Monsanto. 

It's disappointing when people don't take the time to make sure their stories are accurate, especially when they've put so much effort into making sure their post looks nice and their profile looks credible. 

If you're going to post here, please take the time to do a little research to make sure your story is accurate. It'll save you a lot of embarrassment in the long run.

My cousin and I had been working the same boring job for years. We were both unfulfilled and looking for something new and exciting. But when he finally quit, it was surprisingly bittersweet. I got nostalgic for the days when we would crack jokes and make the most of our mundane tasks. Every time I remembered how it was more fun when at least he was there, I cussed, but I also couldn't help but smile.

Despite its usefulness, boxed wine has a stigma that vineyards/companies won't invest in to break. Boxed wine has been seen as a cheap option for those who can't afford the more expensive bottled wines. But with the rise of craft wines, more and more people are turning to boxed wine as a way to enjoy a quality wine without breaking the bank. So why aren't vineyards and companies investing in the boxed wine market? Perhaps it's because the stigma still exists, and they don't want to be associated with it. But if they did invest in the boxed wine market, they could make a great product that people would be willing to pay for, and break the stigma once and for all.

I just saw a post about someone wanting to buy a new gaming computer, but they were worried about the cost. I had to comment and say, "You can, but it would be a waste. You can get a great gaming experience with a mid-range system, and you'll save a lot of money in the process."

It's tough out there right now. It's hard to find a job, especially one that you like. But don't give up hope. There are still ways to find joy in life.

Start by getting a hobby. It can be anything from cooking to playing an instrument to learning a new language. This can be a great way to pass the time, and it can even lead to a new career path.

Another way to find joy is to connect with your family, even if you don't get along. It's important to maintain those relationships and to show them that you care.

Finally, find a few people to be your friends. True friends are the ones that will stick by you through thick and thin. They will be there to listen to your problems and to encourage you.

These are just a few ways to find joy in life, even in tough times. It won't be easy, but it's worth it. Things will get better.

People are cunts. It's a sad truth, but it's true. It seems like no matter how much effort you put into being a good person and trying to make the world a better place, there are always those out there who will try to bring you down and make your life miserable. It's frustrating and disheartening, but it's something we all have to deal with. We just have to keep our heads up and keep pushing forward, because in the end, good will always prevail.

ELI5: 
1) Using the tax system to take money from the rich to pay for programs that help the poor is a way of redistributing wealth. This means that people who have more money (the rich) pay more in taxes than people who have less money (the poor). This money is then used to fund programs that help the poor, such as food stamps, healthcare, and education.

2) Obama and his party (the Democrats) tend to prefer this type of redistribution more than the opposition (the Republicans). This is because the Democrats believe that the government should play an active role in helping those in need, while the Republicans believe that the government should focus more on helping people become self-sufficient.

Hey everyone!

I recently started running and have been trying to find ways to stay motivated. One thing I've been doing is setting small goals for myself, like running a certain distance or running to a certain place. But I've also been trying to focus on the experience of running, rather than just the goals. 

To that end, I've been trying to "show, don't tell" when it comes to running. Instead of thinking about how far I want to run or how fast I want to go, I've been trying to focus on how my body feels when I'm running, how the scenery looks, and how I'm feeling mentally. 

I find that this approach helps me to stay in the present and enjoy the experience of running more. It's also helped me to stay motivated and keep pushing myself, because I'm able to appreciate the process of running rather than just the end result. 

Has anyone else tried this approach? What has been your experience?

I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I've always been fascinated by the idea of the Jedi and the Sith. It's clear that the Sith were able to manipulate Anakin because of his weak will, and it's always made me wonder if the Jedi can do the same. Can the Jedi manipulate weak minded people into following their will, or is it just the Sith who can do this? Is it a power exclusive to the Sith, or do the Jedi have the same ability?

Hey everyone, 

I'm sure we've all had the unfortunate experience of playing a game of League of Legends and running into someone who claims to be on a smurf account but actually just sucks. It's really annoying and can ruin the game for everyone.

That's why I'm here to say: If you're one of those people, STFU! No one wants to hear your excuses, and it's not helping anyone.

Instead, why not be helpful to the nooblets out there? Offer advice, give tips, and be friendly. That's how we all got better at this game and it's the best way to help others improve too.

So, let's all be helpful to each other, not condescending dickshits.

Hey everyone, 

If you're looking to improve your game in League of Legends, I recommend you to look up your champion on www.solomid.net/guides and follow the build they recommend. Even if you feel confident in your own build order, it's still worth taking a look at the recommended builds to see if there are any adjustments you can make to better suit your playstyle. 

Also, when you hit level 30, don't rush into ranked games. You'll likely end up losing and people in ranked flame way harder than in normals, even when you're winning. So take your time and practice in normals first.

Good luck, and have fun!

Hey everyone! 

I'm sure many of us have our main accounts and our smurf accounts. I love playing on my smurf because I don't take it too seriously. I troll and carry and I don't get angry at my teammates when I lose. After a few losses, I just laugh it off and keep playing, because I'm having fun. 

It's important to remember that League of Legends is a game, and it's meant to be fun. So if you're having a bad streak, don't get mad at your teammates and don't take it out on them. Just take a deep breath and keep playing. That's the best way to enjoy the game. 

Thanks for reading, and I hope you all have a great day!

My experience smurfing in League of Legends has been largely positive, but for a rare few I've encountered, it can be quite the opposite. I've seen players who have had a negative attitude, who have been overly aggressive, or who have just been downright toxic. These players can ruin the experience for everyone, and it's important to try to avoid them.

I've also seen players who are new to the game, or who are returning after a long break, and they may not be aware of the current meta or the most effective strategies. It's important to be patient and understanding with these players, as they can be a great asset to your team if given the chance.

Overall, smurfing can be a great way to improve your skills and have fun. Just remember to be respectful and understanding of your fellow players, and you should have a great time.

Hey everyone,

I know it can be really discouraging when people call you bad while playing League of Legends. It can be really disheartening to hear, but don't let it get you down. Just keep playing, and keep ignoring players. Just remember, if they get matched up with you, they are just as bad, if not worse than you, due to them getting matchmaked with you.

So don't let these people get you down. Instead, just focus on improving your skills and having fun playing the game. Don't let the negativity of other players drag you down.

Good luck on the Rift!

Smurfs may get frustrated and angry at times, but at least they don't do or say anything that makes you facepalm. On the other hand, noobs that are open to suggestions and willing to learn are just as good, if not better. Sure, they may mess up a few times, but with the right guidance and a bit of patience, they can be just as good as the more experienced players. So don't write off the noobs just yet!

Hey everyone,

I'm sure many of us have experienced this in ranked games, but I'm just curious if anyone else has had this happen to them too. I'm a Diamond player in League of Legends and I've been climbing the ladder for a while now, but I've noticed that I get flamed almost every game, even when I'm carrying the team. I'm usually the one getting the most kills, objectives, and pushing the hardest, but I still get flamed for it.

I know it's part of the game, and I'm not asking for special treatment or anything, but it's still really frustrating. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you deal with it?

I'm talking about the only part of the picture that matters any more: the software. We've come to a point where hardware is becoming increasingly commoditized, and the real differentiator between devices is the software. We're seeing this more and more with phones, tablets, and even laptops. The hardware is becoming less and less important, and the software is what makes the difference. Whether it's the operating system, the apps, or the services, it's the software that makes the device.

Chicagoans, 

I'm voting "no" on this amendment because it does nothing to address our $83 billion pension liability. It's a distraction from the real problem: our elected officials. 

It's time for us to hold our elected officials accountable and demand real change. We need to make sure they're doing the hard work of finding real solutions to our pension crisis. 

We can't let them get away with passing the buck and passing the blame. We need to stand up for ourselves and make sure our elected officials are doing the job we elected them to do. 

Thanks for reading and please consider voting "no" on this amendment.

I'm a long-time sufferer of anxiety and panic attacks, and I've recently been struggling with a fear of shitting myself. It's something that's been a problem for me for a while, but my general anxiety and panic attacks have been improving the last few months.

I'm posting because I wanted to let the OP know that they are not alone in this fear. It's something that I've struggled with for a while, and it can be really hard to deal with.

I'm not sure if I have any advice on how to deal with this fear, but I just wanted to let the OP know that they are not alone. There are other people out there who are struggling with the same thing.

If anyone else has any advice or tips for dealing with this fear, I'd love to hear it.

Thanks, and take care.

Romney, a professional race car driver, was asked to drive around in a clown car (aka the GOP). He refused, saying that it was too dangerous and that he was not interested in the circus.

He also said that he wanted to be part of a party that was serious about winning, not one that was just clowning around.

Recently, a poll was released that claimed to show that a majority of Palestinians support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However, the poll was conducted by an organization with strong ties to the Israeli government, and even the pro-Palestinian organization supposedly behind the poll were distancing themselves from having any relation to it. 

There is indeed a whiff of confirmation bias here, with the poll being used to support a pre-existing narrative. It's important to take polls like this with a grain of salt, and to look at the context of who is behind the poll and what their agenda might be. I don't think I'm the one who smells something fishy here.

The idea that the Iranian people are not the same as their government is dishonest and self-delusional. Iranian culture is still fairly traditional, which in turn continues to make the Islamic Republic relevant. The Iranian people have been living under the rule of the Islamic Republic since 1979, and while they may not agree with all of its policies and decisions, they still abide by them. This is why, despite the sanctions and other pressures, the Iranian people continue to support their government. The Islamic Republic has been able to maintain its power and relevance by appealing to the traditional values of the Iranian people. This is why it is important to understand the culture and values of the Iranian people in order to understand the Islamic Republic.

Ahmedinajad and the Mullah have created a false narrative that all Iranians are terrorists, and that they all run on nuclear energy. This is simply not true. The people of Iran are hardworking and educated, and they are not the insane terrorists that they are made out to be. 

Unfortunately, the Mullah and Ahmedinajad have created a regime that has oppressed its people, and they are the ones that need to die. The people of Iran deserve freedom and democracy, and they should not be held back by a corrupt government. 

Furthermore, Ahmedinajad looks like a monkey. He is a disgrace to Iran and should be removed from office. 

It's time for the people of Iran to take back their country and to create a government that serves their interests. It's time for the Mullah and Ahmedinajad to go.

It has long been accepted that the monotheistic belief systems of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are based on the notion that Yahweh/Allah/God is the one and only true God. Statements such as “There is no god but Allah” and “You shall have no other gods before Me” are often seen as evidence of this belief. However, recent archaeological and linguistic anthropological evidence has shown that the belief in Yahweh/Allah/God as a monotheistic Deity is a relatively recent development. This evidence suggests that Yahweh/Allah/God was originally part of a polytheistic pantheon of gods, and that the idea of monotheism was a human-constructed concept. This renders the monotheistic foundations of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam invalid, as their core belief is based on an inherently flawed concept.

Hey ELI5, 

I'm trying to understand the process of how China elects its president. I've heard that it involves 2700 delegates and representatives from all over China, but I don't know exactly how it works. Can someone explain it to me like I'm five? 

So here's how it works: 2700 delegates and representatives from all over China elect a Central Committee (~370 from a pre-chosen party list). This Central Committee then elects a Politburo, which is made up of 24 members. The Politburo then elects an exclusive 9-member committee called the Standing Committee, and the head of this committee is the President of China. 

So basically, the 2700 delegates and representatives elect a Central Committee, which elects a Politburo, which in turn elects a Standing Committee, and the head of that is the President. 

Hope this helps!

"Hey everyone,

This is a common misconception about the Communist Party. The Communist Party isn't a political party like the Democrats or Republicans. Instead, it's a workers union. That means it's a group of people who come together to advocate for better working conditions and wages for workers.

Unlike with political parties, you don't vote for different unions. Instead, you vote for who does what within the union. For example, you might vote for a president of the union, or a treasurer, or someone to negotiate contracts with employers.

So while the Communist Party isn't a political party, it still plays an important role in the lives of workers. It helps to ensure that workers have a voice in the workplace and can fight for better wages and conditions.

Hey guys, 

So I was driving home from the store the other day and got into a pretty bad car accident. It was really scary, and I'm just thankful that I'm okay. 

Anyway, after the accident, I was listening to the radio and this song came on that really spoke to me in that moment. It's called "Upside Down" by Woah Man. It's a really powerful song and I just wanted to share it with y'all. 

Take care and stay safe everyone!

Leatheism. LeTheism.

Leatheism is the belief that leather is the best material for fashion. From leather jackets to leather boots, the look, feel, and quality of leather simply can't be beat. The smoothness of the material, the way it molds to your body, and the fact that it's durable and long-lasting make it a great choice for fashion. Whether you're looking for a classic style or something more modern, leather is the way to go. So why not embrace Leatheism and show your love for leather?

I'm a big fan of MMA and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills. Recently I've been trying to focus on learning as much as I can from every position. I've been trying to learn a variety of techniques from every position, so that I can have a wide range of options to choose from. Once I have a considerable amount of options from every position, I can then refine my skill set and focus on the techniques that work best for me.

I'm curious to hear what other MMA fans do to improve their skills. What strategies do you use to learn and refine your skills?

"Yes, the universe is big. It's really, really big. But if you look at a spade of freshly-turned earth, you'll find thousands of better candidates for godhood.

The soil contains so many organisms and microorganisms that it's impossible to count them all. Each of these organisms is capable of performing complex tasks and interacting with its environment. They are capable of growth, adaptation, and even reproduction.

These organisms, though small, are far more impressive than any god we could imagine. They may not have the power to create the universe or control the weather, but they are living, breathing creatures that are capable of surviving in a variety of environments and adapting to change.

So, the next time you think about gods, remember the thousands of tiny organisms in a spade of freshly-turned earth. They may not be as grand as the gods of old, but they are far more impressive."

What is the one thing that you absolutely despise about pop music?

I wouldn't rid the world of a genre, just of radio music. Radio music has been so overplayed and over-saturated that it's almost unbearable to listen to. It's like hearing the same song over and over again, but with a different artist. I'd much rather hear something fresh and new, something that hasn't been heard a million times before. What's the point of having a genre if all you hear is the same thing? There's so much more out there that's worth exploring and discovering.

I'm currently working on a 2-player Plants vs. Zombies-style game, and I'm really excited about it! I'm hoping to have it ready to show off soon, so I wanted to share a bit about it here. 

The game is called Superbase, and it's a competitive tower defense game where you and your opponent have to build a base and defend it from waves of monsters. You'll have to strategically place your towers, upgrade them, and deploy special abilities to survive. 

I've been posting screenshots of the game on my blog, so if you're interested in seeing more you can check it out here: [superbase]( - this is my new blog; I sometimes post screenshots here.

It seems to me that a lot of Americans have an irrational fear of national healthcare. I mean, most of the world has that kind of system and is successful, why would America be different?

It's true that many countries in the world have some form of national healthcare, and they're doing just fine. In fact, they're doing better than the US in many ways. The US spends more on healthcare than any other country in the world, yet it has some of the worst health outcomes. It's not just about the cost either. The US also has some of the highest rates of infant mortality, maternal mortality, and preventable deaths.

So why is there such an irrational fear of national healthcare in the US? It's hard to say for sure, but I think it has a lot to do with the power of the healthcare industry in the US. The healthcare industry is one of the most powerful lobbies in the US, and it has a vested interest in keeping the current system in place. It's also likely that many Americans simply don't understand how national healthcare works, and are scared of the perceived consequences of it.

Regardless of the reasons, it's clear that the US needs to make some changes to its healthcare system. National healthcare could be the answer, and it's time for Americans to take a more rational look at the issue.

If I can't enjoy Skyfall, no one can.

I recently had a falling out with an old friend who was really into the James Bond movies. We had planned to go see Skyfall together, but obviously that didn't happen. 

So I decided to take a little petty revenge. I bought tickets to the movie for everyone in our old group of friends, and then sent out an email saying that I had gotten them as a surprise. I also added a PS at the end that said "I won't be able to make it, so enjoy the movie without me!"

It felt good to get a little revenge, and I'm sure everyone had a great time at the movie. But I'm still a little bitter that I couldn't enjoy it with them.

So if you're looking to have some fun and party, come join me! I'm always down for a good time. But if you'd rather go somewhere else, that's cool too. Just make sure you have a good time wherever you go.

Cheers!

I'm new to Star Citizen and I'm just getting started with customizing my ship. I've seen some really cool ships with flames painted on them and I'm wondering if it's possible to paint flames on my ship. Does anyone have any advice on how to do this? Is it just a matter of finding a good paint job or is there something else I need to do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I don't usually like to brag, but I just saved a familiar shop owner at least a couple hundred bucks by pointing out a pricing error. I was in the store looking for a bottle of bourbon when I noticed that a bottle of Buffalo Trace Stagg and a bottle of Weller were both priced at $100. I knew that Stagg was usually much more expensive than Weller, so I asked the owner about it. Sure enough, he had made a pricing mistake and was about to sell them both at the same price. He was so thankful that I caught it, and I was able to score Stagg and Weller for $100. Feels good to help someone out and get a good deal!

Hey everyone,

I'm looking for some advice on how to use Skype. I recently started using it for video conferencing with my colleagues, but I'm having some difficulty figuring out how to use it properly. Does anyone have any tips or advice for me?

I am typical. I'm a 26 year old guy, living in a small city in the Midwest. I work a 9-5 job and spend my free time with family and friends. I'm not particularly athletic, but I like to keep active. I'm an introvert, but I'm not shy. I'm looking for someone to share my life with, someone who can be my best friend and more. I'm honest, loyal, and kind, and I'm looking for someone who shares those qualities. If you think we might be a good fit, let me know!

I'm not sure what you're asking for, but I'm assuming you want a Reddit post about food that has the title "Is basically 'you agree with some bullshit'."

Here's an example post:

I'm so tired of hearing people say "you agree with some bullshit" when it comes to food. We all have different tastes and preferences, and what works for one person might not work for another. So let's stop judging each other's food choices and just enjoy what we like!

Hey everyone, 

I was at Ski Dazzle today and noticed they have some really good deals on some of their gear. If you're looking for a good deal on some snowboarding gear, definitely check out Ski Dazzle. I got a great deal on a new board and bindings. 

Happy snowboarding!

My dog is ridiculously expensive and also ridiculously awesome. I regret nothing.

I recently adopted a purebred German Shepherd from a breeder, and I was shocked at how much it cost. I was expecting a few hundred dollars, but it ended up costing me almost a thousand. I was a little hesitant at first, but I'm so glad I went through with it.

My dog is the best. He's so smart, he learns commands very quickly. He loves to play and loves to cuddle. He's so loyal and protective, and I feel so safe with him around. He's also a great companion and loves spending time with me.

I'm so glad I decided to splurge on my dog. Even though it was expensive, it was worth every penny. I regret nothing.

Gas prices have been dropping for a while now and it's great for those of us who drive a lot. But when it comes to MPG, it's not as great of a deal as you'd think. Sure, MPG helps, but it's not as beneficial as it would be if gas prices were higher. 

For example, if you drive an average of 12,000 miles a year and get 25 MPG in your car, you'd save $120 from the lower gas prices. That's great, but if you had a car that got 35 MPG, you'd save $200. That's a difference of $80 a year. 

So for the regular driver, MPG only helps a little bit. If gas prices were higher, then MPG would be much more beneficial. But at the current gas prices, it's not as big of a deal.

It seems to me that forming a positive belief that aliens exist is potentially inconsistent with an atheist's refusal to form positive beliefs where there is no evidence. Life is contingent, meaning that it depends on certain conditions in order to exist. We can recognize these conditions and use them as evidence to increase the probability of life existing elsewhere. On the other hand, there are no conditions required for a necessary being, so there is no evidence available to support the existence of such a being. Therefore, an atheist should be more cautious when forming positive beliefs about the existence of aliens, as there is no evidence to support the idea.
|


This is a rather interesting topic to debate. I think that belief in god or gods has nothing to do with aliens. Aliens, by definition, are beings from other planets or galaxies, and god or gods are spiritual entities. The two concepts are completely unrelated and should not be confused.

The belief in god or gods is a personal, spiritual belief that has been around since the beginning of time. It is based on faith and is a way for people to find comfort and meaning in their lives. On the other hand, aliens are scientific and physical entities that have been speculated to exist, but have never been proven to exist. 

The two concepts are very different and should not be confused. Belief in god or gods is a matter of faith, while aliens are a matter of science. Although some people may believe that aliens are related to god or gods, there is no scientific evidence to suggest this. Therefore, belief in god or gods has nothing to do with aliens.

I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you to everyone who helped me with my coding problem.

I got it, thank you!

We often think of distance as a major factor when it comes to size and scale, but in reality, size is the dominant factor. On local scales, distance matters only as part of the function of size and distance, yielding the apparent size. In other words, the farther away an object is, the smaller it appears, but the size of the object is still the dominant factor. 

Take for example a star in the night sky. Even if it is a million light years away, its size is still the same. The only difference is that it appears smaller due to the vast distance between us and the star. Therefore, size is the dominant factor when it comes to local scales. 

This concept is important to remember when we are trying to understand the size and scale of objects in space. Distance matters, but size is the primary factor.

There is no law. This is a concept that many people struggle to understand, and yet it is one of the most important aspects of atheism.

Atheism is the belief that there is no God or divine power. This means that there is no higher power to create or enforce laws. Laws are created and enforced by humans, and therefore they are subject to human interpretation and change.

This means that, while laws can be beneficial, they are not absolute and can be altered or even abolished. It also means that laws can be used to oppress and control people, which is why it is important to have a system of checks and balances to ensure that laws are just and fair.

Ultimately, there is no law beyond that which we create for ourselves. We must take responsibility for our own actions and create laws that are just and fair to all.

Hello everyone!

I recently started playing the game RIFT, and I have to say, it is like Burning Crusade and Lich King expansions from WoW had a baby and that baby grew up into a beastly SteamPunk geek who enjoys painting beautiful portraits just to make people happy.

The game has a lot of different aspects to it, from crafting, to exploring, to questing, and more. The game also has a great art style, with a mix of steampunk and fantasy elements. The graphics are also amazing, and the game runs smooth on my PC.

The game also has a great story line, with a lot of twists and turns, and it is very engaging. The game also has a lot of different classes to choose from, and each class has its own unique abilities and skills.

Overall, I am really enjoying the game, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new game to play. The game is definitely worth checking out, and I can't wait to see what else the developers have in store for us.

Hey everyone,

I feel like PC gamers need to make a statement and show the companies that we prefer to play on our platform, and that we aren't willing to make a sacrifice on the quality of our gaming experience. We've seen time and time again, with games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Fallout 76, that companies are willing to put out sub-par ports on PC, just to get the game out to a wider audience.

We need to make it clear that we're not okay with this. We're willing to pay for quality, and if companies want to make money from PC gamers, they need to make sure that their games are optimized for the platform. We don't want to be the ones making the sacrifice.

So let's make our voices heard, and show the companies that PC gamers aren't willing to settle for anything less than the best.

There's been a lot of talk about introducing duplicate champions into League of Legends, but I'm here to tell you that it's just not gonna happen. It would require too much work and resources, and Riot isn't willing to put that much effort into something that doesn't have a guaranteed payoff. It's just not a priority right now.
|


People are fucking disgusting. I can't believe how selfish and inconsiderate some people can be. They don't think about how their actions affect others and it's really disheartening. It's like they don't care about anyone else but themselves. It's really sad and it makes me angry.

This post is about how bad teams don't necessarily mean bad teamwork on your part. Sure, you might lose more often with "econ builds" (cheaper builds) than you would with "expensive builds", but that doesn't mean that you're doing something wrong.

Winning with "expensive builds" is great and all, but that doesn't mean that you can't still win with "econ builds". It's all about playing smart and working together with your team. Even if you don't have the best mechs, you can still come out on top if you play as a team.

So don't let bad teams and losses get you down. Keep playing smart and working together, and you'll eventually get the wins you're looking for.

I agree that the economy needs to be improved, but I'm concerned that some of the ideas in your manifesto could have harsh consequences for people who have no control over the situation. For example, increasing taxes on businesses could lead to job losses and reduced wages for employees, who are already struggling with the current economic climate. Additionally, cutting government services could lead to an even greater burden on the most vulnerable members of society.

While I understand that some tough decisions need to be made to move the economy forward, I think it's important to consider the potential impacts of these policies on those who are already struggling.

Covenant were often outmatched by UNSC forces on the ground, but their superior space-based firepower gave them the upper hand in most engagements. From the devastating plasma bombardment of Reach to the brutal glassing of Harvest, the Covenant's ability to rain death from above was a major factor in their success. Even when UNSC forces were able to muster enough ground forces to push back the Covenant, their orbital superiority often allowed them to quickly regroup and launch a counter-attack. It's no wonder that the UNSC's space-based capabilities were a major focus of their efforts during the war.

I work at a convenience store and recently had an incident with a customer trying to steal from us.

The customer came in, grabbed a few items, and tried to make a run for it without paying. I shouted at them to stop, but they kept running. I chased after them and eventually caught up with them.

When I confronted them, they tried to deny it, but I had seen them take the items. I asked them to put the items back and pay for them, but they refused.

At that point, I had to call the police. The customer was so embarrassed that they quickly put the items back and paid for them.

The moral of the story: don't steal, you'll only embarrass yourself.

Hey everyone, 

I just wanted to share a piece of advice I've learned over the years: invest in stuff, sell stuff. When it comes to making money, it's a lot easier to make money when you buy something and then sell it for more than you paid for it. You can do this with stocks, real estate, businesses, or even collectibles. 

It's a great way to make some extra money, and you can even turn it into a full-time job if you're good at it. I know it's worked for me and it can work for you too. 

Thanks for reading and happy investing!

**Looks Can Be Deceiving**

I've been playing The WarZ for a few weeks now, and I've noticed something interesting. I've seen players who don't look like they would be good at the game, but they end up being really skilled and successful. On the other hand, I've seen players who look like they should be good at the game, but they end up being really bad. 

It just goes to show that looks can be deceiving. You can't judge a book by its cover, and you can't judge a player by their appearance. You never know what someone is capable of until you see them in action. 

So next time you're playing The WarZ, don't be too quick to judge someone. You might be surprised by what they can do.
|


Hey everyone!

I've been playing The WarZ for a while now and I've noticed that if you die to someone and talk nicely over proximity, they may actually help you out with some of the necessities to start your next life.

I know it's not always the case, but it doesn't hurt to try. You never know what could happen.

So if you ever find yourself in a tough spot, try being friendly and polite. It might just help you out.

Thanks for reading and happy gaming!

Hey everyone,

If you're considering transferring to UC Berkeley, I suggest you get in contact with the Transfer Student Resource Program (TRSP). It's a great way to get the information you need to make sure you meet all the requirements for transferring. Make sure you talk to a counselor and pay attention to what classes you need to take.

Also, don't forget to kick ass in your community college classes for two years. It may seem daunting, but getting a 4.0 GPA is not impossible, and might even be easy if you put in the effort.

Finally, make sure you apply to Cal and wait for your acceptance letter.

Good luck and I hope you get accepted!

It's been a rough season for college football with the lack of leadership in all areas. From the coaches to the players, everyone seems to be struggling to find their footing and make the best of the situation. The lack of leadership has been particularly evident in the way teams have been responding to the pandemic, with coaches and players alike not always following the protocols or taking the necessary precautions. This lack of leadership has led to some teams having to cancel games or postpone them due to positive tests, leaving players and fans alike disappointed. It's time for teams to step up and show some real leadership in order to make college football a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone.

I recently got into a heated argument with an old lady on a plane. It started when she complained about the window seat I was in and how I should move so she could have it. I politely told her that I had paid for my seat and that I wasn't going to move. She then proceeded to start yelling and insulting me, and it didn't take long for the whole plane to hear.

The other passengers soon started to take my side and defend me against her. She eventually gave up and moved to another seat, but not before the whole plane was against her. I have to say, it was a pretty satisfying experience, and I was grateful for the support of the other passengers.

It's easy to think that you need to lose weight when you look in the mirror and see a large chest. But it's important to remember that it's most likely just surface fat or you naturally just have a large chest. It's important to remember that everyone is different and that your body is unique. Don't be too hard on yourself and remember to focus on taking small steps to reach your goals.

I'm sure many of you have heard of the myth that ribs don't move and that fat can't displace them from the inside. Well, I'm here to tell you that this is far from the truth! I recently lost a lot of weight and I noticed that my ribs were actually shifting around as I lost fat. It was a strange feeling, but it definitely happened. So if you're trying to lose weight, don't be afraid to push yourself and know that your ribs will move if you lose enough fat!

It's no secret that Damian Wayne, the son of Bruce Wayne, has a bit of a dark side. He's willing to do whatever it takes to protect Gotham, even if it means killing people. But I personally think that deep down, Damian has a good heart and will eventually learn to do the right thing. He's still young and has a lot to learn, but I think that if he is given the chance to learn from his mistakes and develop feelings for the people he is trying to protect, he could become a great hero. What do you guys think?

I recently came across two articles about the same topic. The titles were different, but the content of the articles were nearly identical in word count. It was obvious that one article was a copy of the other.

So my question to you is: how often do you come across this kind of thing when you're browsing the internet? Have you ever seen articles, posts, or other content that have been copied and pasted without any changes? What do you think of it? Do you think it's wrong to do this kind of thing?

If you're looking for a board to ride around the city for cruising and transportation purposes, I would highly recommend getting a longboard over a mini cruiser or a nickel with mods. Longboards are generally more stable, have better grip and are more comfortable to ride. Plus, they look really cool. 

If you really like the aesthetics of the original Penny board, you can always customize it with some grip tape and new colors. That way, it will be more suitable for city riding and will look great too. 

In terms of sizing, if you're around 6 feet tall and 200 pounds, a Penny Nickel should be just fine. I'm 5 foot 9, 160 pounds and wear size 11, and my Torpedo is just fine under me. Just make sure to adjust the bushings to your weight and riding style. 

Good luck!

Hey everyone,

I know that the new champion, Senna, has been the topic of much debate. Many people have been critical of her design, her abilities, and the direction of the game. However, I think it's important to remember that we haven't seen her in action yet.

Sure, we have a general idea of what she can do, but until she actually goes live and we can play her in game, we won't know for sure how she plays out. So before we start hating on something we haven't seen, let's wait and see how she plays out. Who knows, she might end up being an awesome champion!

As a long-time League of Legends player, I have to say that Riot's recent policy of changing the year of birth for players is a terrible idea. Even if it was a good policy (which it isn't), changing the year of birth would be a massive disadvantage to players who are already established in the game. It would be like starting from scratch and having to grind your way back up. No one wants to do that. So, in conclusion, I think Riot should reconsider this policy and find a better way to ensure the safety of their players. #changeyearofbirth=gg

GW2 has been a much better experience than WoW or Rift in terms of performance. The 'Ancient Karka' event was a great example of how GW2 is able to deliver a more stable, smooth and enjoyable experience than what Rift has been able to offer with its invasions. GW2 is a buy-to-play game and while there are still some issues to be ironed out, the overall performance is much better than what you'd find in a free-to-play game like Rift.

Rift's expansion and subscription prices aren't cheap either. You're looking at around $35 for the expansion and $10-$15 for the subscription. And yet, despite the cost, the performance issues remain. There's no new race or class, just a soul for each class, and the balance in PvE and PvP is far from ideal. Patches come with as many bugs as WoW or GW2.

In comparison, GW2 is a much better value for money and a much more enjoyable experience.

Grandma's house was always the place to go for a refreshing childhood treat. Every time I visited, I knew I could count on a cold glass of spearmint soda.

Hey everyone,

I think this whole issue can be solved with some enforced publicly known rules. The rules should be enforced by the CivCraft moderators and should be made known to the entire server. This would help with enforcing the rules and making sure everyone is on the same page.

The rules should be clear, concise, and easy to understand. They should cover all aspects of the game, including but not limited to: griefing, raiding, stealing, and trading. All of these should be addressed in the rules and punishments should be clearly stated for those who break them.

This would help ensure that everyone is playing by the same rules and would help reduce the amount of conflicts that arise on the server.

What do you think? Do you think this would be a good solution to the current issues?

Let me know your thoughts!

It's been a few months since news broke about Kevin Clash, the former puppeteer for Sesame Street's Elmo character, and the allegations of underage relationships. Though the case was settled out of court, Clash has now resigned from Sesame Street. 

It's unclear why Clash chose to settle and resign, but it's likely that he was looking to avoid a lengthy and costly court battle. It's possible that the settlement was a way for Clash to put the issue behind him and move on with his life. 

What's clear is that the allegations against Clash have been a huge blow to Sesame Street, a beloved children's show. It's understandable why the show's producers wanted to put the scandal behind them as quickly as possible, and settling the case and having Clash resign was the best way to do that. 

It's a sad situation all around, but hopefully this will be the end of the story and Sesame Street can move on and continue to bring joy to children all over the world.
|


It's been a few days since the news of the allegations against Clash broke and the silence from him has been deafening. He has yet to make any comment on the matter and has stayed out of the public eye.

This silence is only making things worse for Clash as it gives the impression that he is guilty of the accusations made against him. Not only is he not denying the accusations, he is not even addressing them at all.

Clash himself is the only one giving these accusers any credibility through his actions, which on the surface appear very guilty. This could be a huge mistake on his part and could have a disastrous effect on his career.

It's time for Clash to come out and address these allegations. If he is innocent, he needs to prove it. If not, he needs to accept the consequences and move on. Either way, the sooner he speaks out, the better it will be for him and everyone involved.

My heart is filled with joy and gratitude every day for having the best submissive in the world. She is so devoted, so loving, and so giving. I am the luckiest Dom in the world to have her in my life and I am so thankful for the connection we share. 

Our relationship is built on trust, respect, and communication. We both work hard to make sure our connection is strong and that we are both happy and fulfilled. 

I am constantly in awe of her strength and her willingness to please me. She is always willing to go the extra mile and never hesitates to show her devotion. 

I couldn't be luckier to have her in my life. She is my everything and I am so grateful for her.

Hey everyone,

I'm sure a lot of us have been in the situation where we feel like we have to win a certain number of games in a set or hit a certain MMR to feel successful. I'm here to say that it's time to throw away those arbitrary goals and set our own!

Playing Dota is supposed to be fun, and if we're constantly stressing ourselves out to hit a certain goal, we're missing out on the joy of the game. So why not set your own goals? Maybe it's to learn a new hero, or master a certain skill, or just play for fun. Whatever it is, make sure it's something that will make you happy and excited to play.

So go ahead and fuck the match point. Set your own goals and enjoy the game!

Hey everyone,

I know it's easy to get stuck in a rut when it comes to playing games, especially if you're a fan of competitive games like Dota 2. I'm sure many of you have been playing for hours on end, and it's easy to get burned out.

So my advice is to take a break and play something else for awhile. It doesn't have to be something completely different, but it could be a different genre of game. Maybe something like a puzzle game or a story-driven game.

It's important to give yourself a break and come back to the game with fresh eyes. You'll find that it'll be more enjoyable, and you'll be able to play better when you come back.

Thanks for reading, and happy gaming!

I recently went to an ice cream shop with some friends and was eagerly waiting to get my ice cream. As the woman behind the counter handed me my ice cream, I let out an excited "mmmmm" without noticing the exposed nipples of the woman. My friends started laughing and I was so embarrassed.

Are we being over charged to be over educated for too long with knowledge we neither want nor need?

It's a question that has been asked by many Australians in recent years. With the cost of university tuition fees and the length of time it takes to complete a degree, it's no wonder why people are questioning the value of their education.

The cost of higher education in Australia is on the rise, with the average student graduating with around $30,000 in debt. This is a significant amount of money for someone just starting out in life. On top of this, the length of time it takes to complete a degree can be daunting for some.

At the same time, there are many students who feel they are being taught too much information that they don't need or want to know. This can lead to frustration and a feeling of wasted time and money.

So, are we being over charged to be over educated for too long with knowledge we neither want nor need? It's a difficult question to answer, as everyone's educational needs and goals are different. However, it's important to consider the cost of education and the value of the knowledge you are gaining.

I'm a high school senior and I'm starting to feel the pressure of college applications. I'm trying to figure out what I want to do with my life, but I feel like I'm lost and don't know how to make the right decisions. What advice do you have for someone in my situation?
|


I'm sure there are many things I don't know, but here is everything I do know:

1. Life is short and unpredictable, so make the most of it.

2. Kindness is free and can go a long way.

3. Failure is inevitable, but it can be a great teacher.

4. Everyone has something unique to offer.

5. It's important to take care of yourself before you can take care of others.

6. Learning never stops.

7. Respect yourself and others.

8. Be open to new experiences.

9. Take time to appreciate the small things.

10. Life is a journey, not a destination.

I'd be king of the past. What would I do?

I'd use my knowledge of the future to improve the lives of those in the past. I'd use my influence to promote civil rights, end slavery, and reduce poverty. I'd use my resources to fund education, healthcare, and infrastructure. I'd set up systems of checks and balances to ensure that everyone had a voice in their government. I'd work to ensure that everyone had access to the same opportunities and was treated with respect and dignity. I'd do everything I could to create a better world for all.

I'm sure we've all been in a situation where we feel like we've stated our point well and yet we still get downvoted. It's frustrating and can be disheartening. But in this case, I think I have made my point clear. I have gone into the history of the company and how they act. So, if you don't like it, that's your opinion. But downvoting to hell isn't going to change my point. It's done.

"When I was a baby, my mom told me a story about how she was in her crib one night and saw an old man outside her window, just staring in at her. She said he was planning on taking her away, but luckily her parents heard her crying and came to her rescue.

It's a scary story to tell a little kid, but it's one that has always stuck with me. I think about it every time I'm home alone, and it reminds me to be careful and aware of my surroundings."

Hey everyone,

I'm sure many of you can relate to this: I've been in a relationship for about two years now, and it's been great. We've been through a lot together, and I'm so grateful for our bond.

However, lately I've been feeling like I'm stuck in a rut. We've been having sex the same way for a while, and it's starting to feel a bit boring. I'm not sure how to bring up the topic without making it awkward.

Any advice? Has anyone else been in this situation before?

Thanks!

Hey everyone, 

I know that it can be embarrassing to talk about sex-related issues, but I wanted to reassure anyone who might be feeling anxious about their fapping habits that it's perfectly normal. It's a natural way to explore your sexuality and have some fun.

That said, if you're worried about any potential health risks, it's always a good idea to get tested - just to set your mind at ease.

Thanks for reading and happy fapping!

Hey there! 

I can totally relate to your situation. I had the same thing happen to me when I was younger. It was really disappointing and made me feel like I wasn't cut out for sex. 

But don't get too depressed about it. The first time is usually bad for most guys, and it takes some practice to get it right. Just try it again and you'll be fine. You might cum quickly, but if you keep at it during the same session you'll more than likely have great sex. 

It's important to remember that sex is a skill, and like any other skill, it takes time and practice to get it right. So don't give up, keep trying, and you'll be having great sex in no time. 

Good luck!

Hey everyone! 

I'm relatively new to guitar playing and I'm looking for some advice on open tunings, practice, and listening to lots of blues. I've been playing for about a year and have been trying to learn some open tunings, but I'm having some trouble with them. I'm also trying to practice regularly and listen to lots of blues, but I'm not sure what to focus on. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

We all have our own special way of being stupid. Don't blame faith when it's really just a cover up for the real issue. Instead of belittling people for not knowing something, we should be helping them learn and educating them. We should be treating everyone better and not assuming that we know more than them. We're all in this together, and we should be helping each other out, not tearing each other down.

My friend is a very religious person, but no one knows it because he was brought up to respect what other people believe, even if it disagrees with his own beliefs. It's easy to immediately dismiss someone who has different beliefs than us, but I think it's important to talk with them and get to know them before making any judgments. Your friend may surprise you with their views and you may even find common ground. So don't be so quick to judge, take the time to talk to your friend and form your own opinion.
|


It's easy to blame religion for the world's problems, but it's also easy to forget that it's the people using it as an excuse to justify their actions or gain power over others that are really to blame. Religion is often used as a tool to manipulate the masses, but it's important to remember that it's the people behind it that are the real problem. We must focus on holding those people accountable for their actions, rather than just blaming the religion itself for the world's ills.

This post is about my experience with smoking for the first time. I was so anxious, I thought I was going to have a panic attack. I was so scared of doing something wrong, or not understanding what I was doing. But, after a while, I figured it out. It took a lot of 'soul searching' to get to that point, but I eventually got there. 

I know it can be really hard to get through the anxiety and fear that comes with trying something new, especially something like smoking. I can tell you from experience that it does get easier. As you learn more about yourself, you will be able to handle things better. 

I hope this post can help someone else who is going through the same thing. All I can say is, don't give up! You can do it, and it will get easier. Just take it one step at a time.

Hey everyone,

I'm new to the subreddit and I wanted to share something with you all. I recently read an article about the benefits of trees and how they can help us in so many ways. It really made me think about how important trees are to our environment and how we can all do our part to help them. 

After reading the article, I decided to take a walk in the woods and just take in the beauty of the trees around me. I was amazed at how calming it was and how it made me feel. It was an amazing experience and it really opened my eyes to the importance of trees. 

It took me almost an hour and a half to read the article and take my walk in the woods, but it was worth it. I hope this post inspires you to take some time to appreciate the trees around you and to think about how you can help them. 

Thanks for reading!

Hey everyone! 

If you're looking to improve your overall wellbeing and find true happiness, then meditation is the way to go. It's something that can help you reach a baseline level of functionality, stability, and health, and if you want to go beyond that, it can help you reach a level of self-perfection, universal wisdom, and complete happiness. 

Before you start an intensive meditation practice, it's important to get all the other stuff in your life in line - make sure you're eating right, getting enough sleep, exercising, and managing stress. Once you have that all taken care of, you can begin your meditation practice. 

Good luck!

I recently did something I regret: I poured hot oil in my girlfriend's ear to cure her earache. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but I didn't realize how dangerous it was. She screamed in pain and I felt horrible. I knew I had to take her to the hospital right away, and thankfully she was okay. But I learned a valuable lesson from this experience - never try to cure an earache with hot oil!

I know this might sound crazy, but guys should really consider trying Viagra. I know it's usually associated with older men, but it can be really helpful for younger guys too. It doesn't leave you with a raging boner all the time, but it can help with erectile dysfunction and other issues. It's important to talk to your doctor before taking any kind of medication, so don't just order it on the internet. Viagra can be a great solution for guys that are struggling with their sexual performance.

My grandmother gave my daughter sleeping pills at my grandson's wedding. I was so embarrassed and angry that I didn't know what to do. She said it was for her own good so she wouldn't be too tired later in the evening, but I felt like she was trying to control my daughter's behavior. I'm not sure what to do about it. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?

I recently agreed to hook a brother up with some headies in exchange for taking my slut away. Little did I know, he also wanted to get head as well. When he didn't show up, I had to become a pimp to get my slut a percocet.

I have a friend who recently got out of a long-term relationship and was feeling down. He met a new girl and seemed to be really happy. But things took a turn for the worse when he went out with her one night. He ended up getting roofied by this girl and then was ass raped by a dildo and/or vibrator.

My great-aunt was always trying to be supportive and comforting in my time of grief, but her thick accent made it difficult for me to understand her. I was in tears, and all I could make out was "You are a retard". I was so embarrassed and confused that I just ran away.

It wasn't until a few years later that I realized she had actually said "You are a treasure".

I was a kid who had a lot of skin problems, and one of the things my mom used to do to help me was to rub a special boob cream on my face every day. I didn't know why she was doing it at the time, but I later found out that the cream was actually for treating ringworm. I guess I was a bit of an odd kid because I actually enjoyed the experience and would beg my mom to do it every day. Little did I know that it was actually helping to treat an infection!

Don't do it! 

I know it's tempting to buy that new guitar you've been eyeing, but don't do it! You'll only be setting yourself up for disappointment and buyer's remorse. 

It's easy to get swept up in the excitement of buying something new. But, take a step back and think about it. Do you really need a new guitar? Do you have the money to spend? Do you have the time to learn a new instrument? 

If the answer to any of these questions is no, then don't do it. Save your money, and use it for something else. 

Thanks for listening!

I think the idea of trying to complete games for percentage completion is misguided. Sure, it might be satisfying to see a 100% completion rate, but it doesn't really measure your skill in playing the game. It's more of a measure of luck and guessing. I'd much rather try to complete a game as quickly as possible, or set some other challenge to measure my skill. For example, if I want to measure my skill in Minesweeper, I might set a goal of completing it in under 100 seconds. That way, I'm testing my skill in the game, rather than just relying on luck.

Hey everyone, 

I've been playing a lot of video games lately, and I've noticed that a lot of people don't know how to get better at the game. I've been trying to help people out by giving advice and tips on how to improve their gameplay, and one thing I've noticed is that the middle is still the best place to be in most games. 

I know some people don't like hearing that and it can come off as a bit abrasive, and I'm sorry if I've come off that way. It's just that when I try to explain something to people, I like to provide sources and examples to back up my points. That's why my posts tend to be a bit long. 

If you're interested in taking your gaming to the next level, I'd highly recommend checking out [insert website here]. It's a great resource for learning more about the serious side of gaming. 

Thanks for reading, and happy gaming!

It's funny how sometimes our natural instincts don't always work in our favor. Take the game of tic-tac-toe for example. We tend to think that the best first move is to take the corner spot, but it's actually one of the worst moves you can make. Taking the corner spot gives your opponent the opportunity to take the center spot and gain a huge advantage. So next time you play tic-tac-toe, remember that corner is the worst possible first move...sometimes natural instincts aren't helpful at all.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years and it's been great. Recently, he's been pushing me to do things that I'm not comfortable with. He's been pressuring me to go to parties with him and do things that I don't want to do. He says it's all in good fun and I'm being too serious, but it's making me really uncomfortable. I've tried talking to him about it, but he just doesn't seem to understand why I don't want to do these things. I'm really starting to feel like this relationship isn't worth it if I'm not respected and my feelings aren't taken into consideration. This is in no way worth it.

This post is about how some people on Reddit have been posting about their suicidal thoughts or feelings, and then at the end of the post adding something like "just kidding" or "just trolling" as if it were a joke. 

I think this kind of behavior is really inappropriate and disrespectful. It's not funny to make light of someone's mental health struggles, and it's definitely not okay to joke about suicide. If you're feeling suicidal, please reach out to someone you trust or a mental health professional. 

Making jokes about suicide is not only insensitive and hurtful, but it can also be triggering for those who are struggling with suicidal thoughts. It can make them feel like they're not being taken seriously or that their feelings are not valid. 

So please, if you're feeling suicidal, don't joke about it. Seek help and support from those who care about you and respect your feelings. And if you're not feeling suicidal, don't make jokes about it. It's unnecessary and rude.

If you're looking to get into Shadowrun, I highly recommend checking out the free Quickstart guide before you spend any money. It'll give you a great idea of whether or not the game system is right for you. If you decide to go ahead and invest in the 20th Anniversary edition, you should also plan on getting at least 10d6 per player plus an additional 10-20d6. After that, I recommend picking up the Augmentation, Street Magic, Unwired, and Companion supplements in that order, depending on what you feel you need. The Sixth World Almanac is an awesome resource, and I suggest reading it even if you don't end up liking the game system.

Vehicles used to be crutches for low-skill players in the Halo franchise, but recent tweaks have made them much more difficult to use effectively, forcing vehicle operators to use skill and planning in order to be successful. The introduction of the "vehicle health" system has made it so that vehicles can no longer take an endless amount of punishment, and the introduction of the "vehicle boost" system has made it so that vehicles no longer move at lightning speed. These changes have increased the skill gap between players who know how to use vehicles effectively and those who don't, and have made vehicles more of a strategic asset than a crutch.

I recently had a discussion with a friend about the risk of damage to an unstrung guitar. My friend was of the opinion that an unstrung guitar was more vulnerable to damage than an unmounted guitar neck. I argued that the risk of damage is the same for both, since the neck is the most vulnerable part of the guitar and is equally exposed in both cases.

After some back and forth, we decided to ask around to see if anyone else had any opinions on the matter. So, what do you think - is an unstrung guitar at more risk for damage than an unmounted guitar neck?

Hey ladies, 

I'm curious what you think about the idea that guys should just pay the bill without her noticing on the first few dates. If she doesn't return the favor after 3 dates, then it's time to move on.

I'm all for chivalry, but I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not. What do you think? Is this a good way to show respect and appreciation for a woman, or is it a bit extreme?
|


I think it's not threatening at all, it shows manners... do it but let him pay anyway ;)

When it comes to dating, I believe in the old-fashioned approach of letting the guy pay. It's a sign of respect and appreciation, and it shows him that you value him and the time you spend together. I know it can feel awkward to let him pay, especially if you make a decent salary yourself, but it's a nice gesture that will make him feel appreciated. So if he offers to pay, don't be afraid to accept it. It's not a threat, it's a sign of good manners.

The title of this post is a bit misleading. HDMI and DVI are not the same.

When it comes to physical attractiveness, it's not the only thing that matters. Girls put a lot of emphasis on personality too. As we get to know someone better, our perception of their looks can change. Depending on what stage of life you're in, girls may be looking for different things. For example, when you're young, physical looks may be more important, but as you get older, personality and compatibility become more important. Ultimately, it's important to remember that physical attractiveness is not the only thing that matters, and that it's important to focus on developing a strong personality and finding someone who is compatible with you.

Hey everyone,

I'm sure many of us have heard the phrase "looks don't matter as much as confidence" before, but what does it really mean? How can you tell if someone is truly confident or just putting on a show?

I think confidence is something that comes from within. It's a combination of self-esteem, self-belief, and self-assurance. It's not just about how you look or what you wear, but rather how you carry yourself and interact with others.

Confidence can be a tricky thing to measure, but it's something that can make a huge difference in how you are perceived. It's also something that can be cultivated over time.

So, if you're looking to improve your confidence, start by believing in yourself and your abilities. Surround yourself with people who are supportive and positive. Take time to focus on your strengths and weaknesses and work on improving them. And, last but not least, practice positive self-talk and be kind to yourself.

Hey everyone, 
I recently had a conversation about how it doesn't seem right to put one sex regarding looks as less important than the other as both sexes feature a wide range of personalities and approaches to dating. I acknowledged that it was somewhat less than that with women. I said that it was not that much less than attractive women with fat men. I honestly haven't seen either that often, so in my experience one isn't greater than the other. I added slightly less than women purely from gained experience from the internet, which increased both. I should have clarified. 

Here's the big thing, men are often the ones asking other's out. So, comparing women asking out fat men, and men asking out fat women (both attractive), in both cases they are relatively rare. However, if you add in accepting a date. In this regard, both cases rise up. In my experience, mature men and women, will both accept someone who they like personality wise, but who is on the pudgy side of things. It is hard to compare the two because current social standards have men asking out women, more often than women asking out men. I have seen very few women actually ask out the nice fat guy, but who would accept. Same with men, they wouldn't ask, but would accept. However, in both cases there are some who will ask out the fatter party. 

Sorry for the jumble, I am tired. I'm curious to hear what other people's experiences are when it comes to this topic. Do you think that men and women are equally likely to ask out someone who is on the pudgy side, or do you think that one gender is more likely to take that risk? Let me know your thoughts!

Hey everyone, 

I recently bought a Ford Focus ST, and I regret it. It's not as fun as I thought it would be, and it's not great in the snow. Instead, I recommend the Mazda3 hatchback. It's a blast to drive, and it's a lot cheaper in the long run. Plus, it works great in the snow. So if you're in the market for a new car, stay away from the ST and go for the Mazda3--but not the Speed version. 

Hope this helps!

"It's a common misconception that success in League of Legends is all about individual skill. While individual skill is important, it's not the only factor that determines success. A lot of it depends on the skill, awareness, and patience of your team.

If your team is aware of the enemy's movements, communicates well, and takes calculated risks, you're much more likely to win than if your team is simply trying to outplay the enemy in lane.

So, while individual skill is important, it's not the only factor that determines success. Make sure your team is aware, communicates well, and has patience to make the right decisions!"

But now that I'm an engineer, I know that I was wrong. Audiophiles often spend way too much money on equipment that isn't actually any better than what you can get for a fraction of the price. They think they're getting the best sound, when in reality they're just getting tricked into thinking they're getting more than they actually are. 

So take it from a former audiophile - don't fall into the audiophile trap. You can get great sound without breaking the bank."

I'm sure we've all heard of the infamous 'Beer Mile', where you have to chug a beer and then run a lap around a track. Well, I'm here to tell you that that's for pussies. Real men run the Shithoused Six.

The Shithoused Six is a six mile run that you have to do while drinking a beer every mile. That's right, every mile you have to drink a beer. If you can make it to the end, you can call yourself a real runner.

So if you think you have what it takes, grab yourself a six pack and head out for the Shithoused Six. Just remember to stay safe and don't drink too much too fast. Good luck!

The Detroit Lions had a tough decision to make on Sunday night against the Green Bay Packers. With the game tied and just over a minute left in the 4th quarter, the Lions were faced with a 4th and goal from the Packers' 2-yard line. The Lions decided to take the safe route and kick a field goal to take the lead, rather than risk a turnover by throwing the ball.

While some may argue that the Lions should have gone for it on 4th down, I think they made the right decision. The Packers' defense had been playing well all game and the Lions were likely to turn the ball over if they had thrown the ball. Taking the field goal was the second best option and it gave them the lead with only a minute left.

The Lions may have taken the safe route, but they still made the right decision. They didn't throw the ball and risk a turnover, and they still took the lead. It was a tough decision, but the Lions made the right call.

Today I learned that religious people tend to be on the lower side of the IQ chart and tend to know the least about history. This isn't really a surprising thing, considering that our knowledge of history is skewed and based on what we know from over 3,000 years. 

Sorry for the rant, but I guess I'm expecting the downvotes to come rolling in.

Hey everyone,

I recently bought a 4-door Cherokee XJ and I'm looking to get a 2-door gasser. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on what I should do with my current XJ. Should I just sell it as is or salvage what I can from it? I'm thinking of taking the windows, t-case (if it is an HD model), axles, etc. and using them on the new 2-door.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I've been working in retail for almost two years now and I can tell you that it's not an easy job. You're constantly dealing with customers who are angry, stressed, and just plain rude. On top of that, you're expected to be cheerful, helpful, and accommodating. It can be difficult to stay positive in such an environment.

That's why I always tell people who are considering a job in retail to take their sanity into their own hands. If you're not enjoying your job, don't be afraid to quit. But if you're determined to stay, then make it fun. Find ways to make the job more enjoyable by talking to your coworkers, playing games with customers, or even just taking a break to do something you enjoy.

No matter what you decide, remember that it's your job and you have the power to make it a positive experience. So take your sanity into your own hands and make the most of your retail job.

I recently had a customer come in to my store who was trying to return an item he had purchased a few days prior. I told him that since he had already used the item he could not return it, but he became very angry and started to yell at me. I calmly explained that I was just following company policy and that I was sorry for any inconvenience. 

At this point, I had two choices. I could either try to appease the customer and offer a discount or I could stand firm and not give in to his demands. I chose the latter option because I knew that if I gave him a discount, other customers would expect the same. 

My policy is to save the good customers as much money as possible, while still staying within the bounds of the law. But for the customers who are unreasonable and try to take advantage of the system, I will not give in to their demands. 

It's important to remember that as a retail worker, you have to be able to stand your ground and not let customers take advantage of you.

As college football fans, we all know that the current system of deciding a national champion is far from ideal. It leaves us with a system that is often criticized for being unfair and not truly determining the best team in the country. 

What if there was an alternative? What if we could have a 16 team NCAA tournament and 8 team NIT tournament that included conference champions? This would give us a much better idea of who the best team in the country is, and it would be a much more exciting way to decide the national champion. 

I know this will never happen in college football, but I think it would be the best way to decide the national champion. It would be a much fairer system, and it would give us a much better idea of who the best team in the country is. 

What do you think? Do you think this is the best way to decide the national champion, or do you think the current system is better? Let me know your thoughts in the comments!

"I'm new to making cocktails and I thought I'd try something new today. I decided to mix up a concoction of gin, orange juice, and tonic water. It sounded delicious, so I gave it a try. Unfortunately, my experiment didn't turn out as expected. The drink was too bitter and had an unpleasant aftertaste. I guess curiosity killed the cat, and also my cocktail. Has anyone else had a similar experience when trying something new with cocktails?"

Leave Brittany alone!

I'm sure you've heard about the controversy surrounding Brittany Brown and her comments about the NBA. While I understand some of the criticism, I think it's important to remember that Brittany is just a young woman trying to make her way in the world. She's passionate about basketball and has a lot of potential.

I think it's unfair to judge her so harshly for her comments. We all make mistakes, and she's no different. Let's give her a chance to show us what she's capable of.

Let's leave Brittany alone and let her do her thing. She's got a lot of talent and I'm sure she'll prove it in the near future.

Hey everyone,

I just wanted to give a friendly reminder to be careful when taking the subway in NYC. Don't stand too close to the edge of the platform for pushing and fainting reasons. It's dangerous stuff.

It's so frustrating that the gaming industry is so out of touch with their consumers. With the ridiculous prices they charge for games, and the lack of customer service, it's no wonder that piracy is becoming more and more attractive. It's the only option until the industry reforms and takes into account what their customers actually want.

Overclocking is a complex and difficult process that requires a lot of knowledge and skill. There is no "set way" to get overclocking down to a science due to variances in silicon, parts, temperatures, etc, etc, etc. That being said, there are some general principles that one should follow to get the most out of their overclocking experience. 

First and foremost, it is important to keep temperatures in check. Overclocking can result in higher temperatures that can cause instability or even permanent damage to components. Using high quality cooling solutions can go a long way in keeping temperatures under control. 

Second, it is important to know the limits of your components. Overclocking can push components to their limits and beyond, so it is important to know what your components are capable of and to push them only as far as they can go. 

Finally, it is important to experiment and find out what works best for you and your hardware. Different components and systems will respond differently to overclocking, so it is important to find out what works best for you. 

Overall, overclocking can be a rewarding experience if done properly. There is no "set way" to get overclocking down to a science, but following the general principles outlined above can go a long way in helping you get the most out of your overclocking experience.

Hey there Redditors,

I'm sure we've all seen it before: a new show or movie comes out, and the fans are so excited that they can't help but share their enthusiasm with the world. They post about it on social media, write reviews, and share their thoughts with anyone who will listen. And while it's great to be passionate about something, sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming.

That's why I'm here to ask you: when it comes to new shows and movies, keep it to yourselves sometimes, fanbases. Let the show do the talking! Don't spoil the plot, don't share your theories, and don't give away too much information. Let the show speak for itself, and let the audience discover it on their own.

So what do you think? Do you think it's important to keep it to yourselves sometimes, fanbases? Or do you think it's okay to share your thoughts and excitement? Let me know in the comments!

I'm an adult cartoon fan, and I'm tired of having to defend myself against people who assume that I'm a Brony because of it.

If you're looking to open a new hookah lounge, it can be a daunting task. With smoking bans popping up in many cities, it can be hard to find a place to open a lounge without breaking the bank. The hardest part about opening a new one at this point is avoiding smoking bans.

Luckily, there are still some ways to go about it. First, research the laws in your area. Make sure you know the exact laws and regulations for smoking in your city. This will help you find a place to open your lounge that won't violate any laws.

Second, look for a place that is not in a high-traffic area. This will help you avoid any potential issues with the local authorities.

Finally, make sure you have a good business plan. Do your research and make sure you have a plan that will make your lounge a success.

Opening a new hookah lounge can be a difficult process, but if you are smart about it you can do it without breaking the bank. The hardest part about opening a new one at this point is avoiding smoking bans, but with a bit of research and planning you can make it happen. Good luck!

Whether it's a shitty site with a terrible layout is debatable (I personally don't think it is). Does it have zero credibility in metal? Absolutely not.

There are certain websites out there that have been around for years and have built up a solid reputation in the metal scene. These sites often feature reviews, interviews, and other content related to metal music and culture. Even if the site's layout isn't the best, the content is often top-notch and can provide valuable insight into the metal scene.

So, while a website's layout may not be the most aesthetically pleasing, it doesn't mean it has zero credibility in metal. Quality content is what really matters, and as long as a website provides that, it can still be a valuable source of information for metalheads.

Recently, Riot Games has banned a professional League of Legends player for showing toxic behavior in-game. While the ban was justified, many people have been questioning the way Riot handled the situation. In my opinion, Riot should have given the player more of a chance to reform his behavior before taking such a drastic measure. A suspension would have been more appropriate in this situation, and would have also given the player a chance to learn from his mistakes and become a better player. It's understandable that Riot wants to maintain a professional environment, but punishing someone for a single mistake isn't the correct way to go about it.
|


If Riot really wants to enforce such harsh punishments on the pro players that made their game famous in the first place, then they should hold all pro players to the same standards. It's not fair to single out certain players for their mistakes, while others go unpunished for similar offenses. 

Also, people should stop getting so upset about words. It's natural for people to have disagreements and heated debates, but that doesn't mean that it's okay to be rude or insulting. If someone says something that you don't like, then it's best to just ignore it and move on. People should be allowed to express their opinions without fear of being attacked or punished.
|


It seems like Riot Games is trying to make League of Legends into a more 'happy joy land' style game that appeals to the majority of players. While this may be successful in the short term, it is doomed to fail in the long run. The most competitive players will never accept a game that is designed to appeal to the masses. League of Legends is a game that requires skill and strategy, and the most competitive players will always be looking for a challenge. By trying to make the game more accessible to the masses, Riot Games is taking away the challenge that makes the game so appealing to the most competitive players. This is a poor decision, and it will ultimately lead to the game failing to meet the expectations of its most dedicated players.

Documenting your dreams routinely is a tough habit to get into, but it is absolutely necessary if you want to become a better lucid dreamer. Keeping a dream journal will help you to remember more of your dreams and become more aware of the dream state. By writing down your dreams and analyzing them, you can gain insight into your subconscious and learn more about yourself. Additionally, you can use your dream journal to track your progress and set goals for your lucid dreaming practice. So if you're serious about lucid dreaming, make sure to document your dreams routinely - it may be tough at first, but it's worth it in the end!

However, I'm not sure if I'm doing enough to stand out from the competition. Someone sourced Neil Patel in one of the responses, so I figured I should take a look at what he has to say. 

Does anyone have any other advice on how I can make myself stand out from the competition? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Good luck. I hope you land it.

It's easy to get caught up in the theoretical aspects of the game, but it's important to remember that there's a difference between theory and a theory with support. You can't say that a tachyon actually exists as anything more than a theory. Sure, it's possible in theory, but without actual evidence and proof, it's just a theoretical concept. The same goes for strategies and hero builds in Dota 2. You can come up with a theoretically sound strategy, but without actually playing it out and testing it, it's just a theory. Theory is great for brainstorming, but it's the practical application of these theories that make them viable in competitive play.

Proliferation concerns have been a major obstacle to the development of new nuclear technologies, particularly the Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR) and the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR). But these concerns are overblown.

The LFTR and IFR are inherently less proliferation-prone than current nuclear technologies due to their closed fuel cycle, which reduces the amount of plutonium produced. Additionally, LFTRs and IFRs can be designed to produce only small amounts of fissile material, making them much more difficult to divert for weapons use.

Furthermore, the LFTR and IFR are much more efficient than current nuclear technologies, which means that much less nuclear material is needed to produce the same amount of energy. This further reduces the potential for proliferation.

In short, proliferation concerns should not be a major obstacle to the development of the LFTR and IFR. We should stop worrying and embrace these new technologies, as they offer a much safer and more efficient alternative to current nuclear technologies.

I recently bought a new Chevrolet and have been having a few problems with it. One of them is a leak in the engine that has been there since the day I bought it. I took it to the dealership and they said they could fix it, but it would cost me. I agreed and they fixed it. 

Fast forward a few months and the leak is back. I took it back to the dealership and they said they would fix it, but only if I paid for it. I explained that I had already paid for it and they said that the warranty had run out and that I would have to pay for it again. 

I am so frustrated with Chevrolet and their technicians. How can they hire technicians that don't know how to fix a problem and then not stand behind their work? It's ridiculous and I'm never going to buy a Chevrolet again. Fuck you Chevrolet for hiring stupid technicians and being completely able to fix leaks until the warranty runs out at which point you tell people to go pound sand.

Hey everyone,

I recently had a terrifying experience while driving. I was driving along when I suddenly noticed a spider crawling across my dashboard. I almost had a heart attack!

To avoid a similar experience in the future, I have come up with a few tips that might help you avoid the same situation.

1. Make sure to check your car before you get in and start driving. This will help you spot any unwanted guests before they have a chance to surprise you.

2. If you do happen to find a spider in your car, try to stay calm and pull over as soon as possible. This will help you avoid any potential accidents.

3. If you can't pull over, try to keep your eyes on the road and focus on driving safely. Don't let the spider distract you.

Hopefully these tips will help you avoid a similar experience to mine. Stay safe out there!

Boo to dicks like this.

I recently encountered someone who, when asked about their religious beliefs, proudly proclaimed that they were an atheist. When asked why, they said that they believed that all religions were equally false, and that anyone who believed in any religion was an idiot.

It's attitudes like this that give atheists a bad name. Atheism is simply a lack of belief in a god or gods, not a statement about the truth or falsity of any religion. We don't need to be attacking people of faith to make our point. We can simply live our lives without any gods, and let others do the same.

So boo to dicks like this. We don't need them in the atheist movement.

It seems like every day, there's a new story about North Korea, or something related to South Korea, that makes headlines and sparks outrage and indignation. It's understandable. But let's take a breath and look at the facts before we rush to judgement and start calling for action.

Yes, it's important to be aware of what's happening and to hold those in power accountable. But let's at least figure out what's going on before we grab the pitchforks, and cool it with the "FOR KOREA" stuff. We need to know the truth before we can make any real progress.

Let's take a step back and try to get a better understanding of the situation before we start making assumptions. That way we can make sure that any action we take is well-informed and effective.

I just picked up this game yesterday and I have to say, it's a damn fine game! I was a bit hesitant to spend the full $60 (or $65 with tax) on it, but I'm really glad I did. It's a great game with lots of depth and replayability. Plus, I hear the multiplayer is really good too, although I haven't had a chance to try it out yet. All in all, I'd say it was money well spent.

Dumbledore is one of the most powerful wizards in the Harry Potter universe, and his power can be expressed in a number of ways, including through violent force. On the other hand, Gandalf's power lies in his wisdom and guidance, which are much less destructive. In a battle between the two, it's clear that Dumbledore would win because he has the ability to use his power in a violent manner, while Gandalf's power is limited to providing advice and guidance. What do you think?

I recently had a player ask me why regeneration doesn't do anything until the point where state-based actions would kill the creature. I explained that regeneration works differently than other abilities because it is a replacement effect. It replaces the destruction of the creature with a new effect, which is to tap the creature and remove all damage from it. This means that if the creature would be destroyed due to state-based actions, regeneration will take effect before that destruction happens, thus preventing the creature from being destroyed.

I'm in a difficult situation. I'm in a relationship with someone I care about deeply, but our relationship has been unhealthy for a while. We constantly fight, they refuse to compromise, and I feel like I'm always the one trying to make things work. I know it's not right and I don't want to stay in this situation, but I'm afraid to break it off for fear of hurting them.

I know it's hard, but if the relationship isn't healthy, it's better to break it off for the good of both of you. Unless you honestly believe she'll change and want to change, it's not worth staying in an unhealthy relationship. It's never easy to end a relationship, but it's better to do it now than to stay in a situation that's not good for either of you.

Finland will not be getting any Mitsubishi vehicles in the near future. The Japanese carmaker has announced it will not be exporting its vehicles to the Nordic country due to the high cost of production and the small size of the Finnish car market. This means that consumers in Finland will have to look elsewhere for their car needs.

This is a disappointing news for Mitsubishi fans in Finland, as the company has a long history of producing reliable and affordable vehicles. However, with the current economic climate, Mitsubishi has decided that it is not cost-effective to export its vehicles to Finland.

It remains to be seen if Mitsubishi will reconsider its decision in the future, but for now, it looks like Finland will have to look elsewhere for its car needs.

No, economics of scale will not always exist. In fact, the more decentralised a system is, the more it can resist the effects of economies of scale. In a decentralised system, each individual unit is relatively small and can provide the same services or goods as larger units, but without the same fixed costs associated with larger production. This allows for competition and innovation at the local level, which can lead to greater efficiency and lower costs for consumers. In addition, decentralised systems can be more resilient to external shocks and disruptions, as they are not as dependent on a single source of goods or services. Therefore, decentralisation can be a powerful tool for resisting the effects of economies of scale.

My roommate and I just moved in together a few weeks ago, and I'm starting to realize that maybe she's not the best fit for me. It's important to give yourself enough time to determine whether she's a good roommate before making any decisions.

Make sure to take your time and weigh all of your options before deciding if it's worth staying in this living situation.

Confidence is key and it starts with what you wear. So go ahead and show off your style and don't be afraid to be bold.

I'm not sure why OP is being a faggot again, but here's what I remember about the Egyptian gods: According to Egyptian mythology, Ra was the sun god and the ruler of the universe. He was so powerful that he feared his own children, Osiris, Isis, Set, and Nepthys, would overthrow him. So he tricked them into being born outside of the year. To make enough time for them to be born, Ra's wife, Nut, went and gambled with Khonsu, the moon god, for moonlight.

I recently made the switch from a 400L to a 200L and I'm so glad I did. I was originally looking for a lens to expand my kit and give me more range, but I quickly realized that the 400L was just too expensive for what I was getting. Instead, I opted for the 200L which I was able to purchase for only $600. 

The 200L has given me plenty of range and I'm able to get the shots I need without breaking the bank. Plus, if I ever need more megapixels I can always add on a couple of teleconverters to get the job done. 

So if you're looking to expand your kit and you're on a budget, I'd recommend skipping the 400L and going for the 200L. It's a great lens and it won't break the bank. 

Happy shooting!

Graduating college is an exciting time, but it can also be a stressful one. You may be facing the prospect of student loan debt, or other financial obligations. That's why it's important to start building up a graduation nest egg now. 

Start by setting aside a small amount of money each month. Even if it's just $50 or $100, it will start to add up over time. If you can, try to increase the amount you save each month. 

You should also look into ways to reduce your expenses. Consider ways to reduce your rent, transportation costs, and other expenses. This will help you save more money for your nest egg. 

Finally, do your best to avoid taking on new debt. Try to pay for items with cash or a debit card. If you must use credit cards, make sure you pay off the balance each month. 

By taking these steps, you can ensure that you have a solid financial foundation as you enter the workforce. Good luck!

Yes, AJFA is a masterpiece. It is the perfect blend of thrash, power metal, and hard rock that makes it one of Metallica's most beloved albums. The album has some of the band's most iconic songs, such as "One", "Harvester of Sorrow", and "The Unforgiven". It also features some of their most technically impressive songs, such as "The Shortest Straw" and "Eye of the Beholder". AJFA is an essential part of Metallica's discography and one of the greatest metal albums of all time.

It's interesting to think about the dynamic between Bond and M in the recent James Bond films. In Skyfall, Bond gets injured in a mission and M makes the decision to replace him with Eve. Bond is obviously unhappy about this decision, but he still believes in himself and his ability to get the job done. M, on the other hand, doesn't seem to believe in Bond's abilities and makes a bad decision. This is a great example of how Bond's loyalty to M is tested and how M's faith in Bond is tested. It isn't about Bond getting hit or not, it's about who believes they have the ability to get the job done. Bond thinks he does, M makes a bad choice and chooses Eve.

I recently bought a new version of an RPG game I already owned, and I must say that it was not as great as I was expecting. There were some minor improvements, but nothing that really made it stand out from the original. However, I think it is still worth a purchase for anyone who doesn't already own the old version. The graphics are improved, the game play is a bit smoother, and there are some new features that make it a bit more interesting. So, if you don't already own the old version, I'd say it's definitely worth picking up the new one.

"Electric bass pickups aren't designed for a lot of things, but some rules are meant to be broken. I've been experimenting with using electric bass pickups to record acoustic bass guitar. It's not the most conventional way of doing things, but it can yield some really interesting results.

I'm using a single coil pickup and running it through a preamp and then into my audio interface. The sound is a bit more compressed than a traditional acoustic bass, but I'm finding that it adds a unique character to the sound.

It's been a few days since the incident, but I still can't stop thinking about it. I was talking to a coworker about the no cry challenge, and I thought it would be a funny conversation. I ended up telling him about how my dog got put down a few months ago, and it brought up some really sad memories for him. Things got really awkward and I ended up crying in the cooler. I feel so embarrassed and ashamed. I know it was a mistake to bring it up, but it's hard to control my emotions sometimes. I hope I can make it up to him somehow.

I recently made a huge mistake at work. I was talking with a coworker about how her mom was coming for a visit, and I accidentally said to her, "Your mom is so old!" I immediately realized my mistake and apologized profusely, but the damage was done. It was definitely not my proudest moment and I feel really embarrassed about it. I'm hoping my coworker can forgive me, but I'm really not sure if she will.

I drove about 40 minutes with a banana peel resting on my lap, won't be doing that again.

As I was driving, I kept thinking that it was a weird thing to do and that I should get rid of it. But I was in a rush and just kept driving. When I finally arrived at my destination, I realized that the banana peel had left a yellow stain on my pants.

It was a good reminder to not procrastinate and to always be mindful of what I'm doing. I won't be forgetting this lesson anytime soon.

It's important to remember that a search of your car is only permissible if the police have specific evidence that you have contraband, such as drugs or weapons, in your vehicle. Being pulled over or arrested is not blanket authority to search your entire car.

If the police do not have any specific evidence that you have contraband in your car, they cannot search it without your consent. You have the right to refuse a search of your car, and you should exercise that right.

If the police do have specific evidence that you have contraband in your car, you still have the right to refuse the search. However, the police may then get a warrant to search your car and you may be arrested for obstruction of justice if you refuse.

It's important to remember that you have the right to refuse a search of your car if the police do not have specific evidence that you have contraband in your vehicle. Knowing your rights is the best way to protect yourself in these situations.

"I'm sure many of you have had to read through oral argument transcripts for law school exams. I recently had to read through the transcript from the famous BONG HiTS 4 JESUS case, and it actually saved my ass on the exam!

I was able to draw on the facts of the case to answer some of the questions on the exam that I was struggling with. It was a really interesting case to read through, and I'm glad I had the chance to do so.

Has anyone else had a similar experience where reading a case saved them on an exam?"

Hey everyone,

It's not the first time I've felt embarrassed or looked ridiculous, and if I'm being honest, it probably won't be the last. In these situations, it's easy to panic and feel like you've messed up.

But I'm here to remind you that you can take your time, slow yourself down, and assert yourself. It's okay to take a few breaths and assess the situation. You don't have to rush into anything.

Sometimes it's hard to remember this in the moment, but it's important to stay calm and collected. You can do it!

Take care,

My heart was pounding as I sprinted to make the train. I had just made it to the platform when the train started to move. I reached out to grab the door, but the train was moving too fast. As I tried to pull my bag onto the train, it snagged on something. The next thing I knew, I had kicked a kid in the face and I was on my butt. The kid started crying and I felt so embarrassed and horrible. I apologized profusely and offered to buy the kid ice cream, but the kid just ran away. I got up and watched the train leave, feeling like the world's worst person.

"I recently had an experience that taught me the importance of understanding the nuances of language. I had a disagreement with someone about an issue that, in hindsight, could have been easily clarified with a few extra words. But instead, we argued for what felt like hours, each of us getting more and more frustrated. 

In the end, I realized that I should have taken the time to explain my thoughts more clearly and to ask for clarification when I wasn't sure. It reminded me of the size of small novellas - the amount of detail and understanding that can be conveyed in just a few words is incredibly powerful.

Thanks for responding though, I wasn't even sure you'd bother reading my thoughts :P I'm glad you have an interest in not letting misapplication and misinterpretation get out of hand. Could use more people like you in the world."

Hey everyone,

I'm having an issue with the r/AdviceAnimals stylesheet. I'm not sure if it's an RES bug or something else. Basically, when I try to post a meme with the AdviceAnimals template, it doesn't show up correctly. It looks like the template is missing some of its elements.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it an RES bug, or is there something else going on?

I had my first love in summer school when I was 16. We had an on-off relationship for about two years. We had a very complicated relationship, but I loved her deeply. 

Unfortunately, after our last breakup, she committed suicide. I was completely devastated. I still think about her every day and wish I could have done something to help her.

It's not being a Skinhead that makes that statement wrong, it's the fact that the statement is based on hate and bigotry. Skinheads have been associated with racism and violence, and while some may not be motivated by hatred or prejudice, the fact remains that they are often associated with those ideologies. Therefore, any statement that is based on hatred or bigotry is wrong, regardless of who is making it.

I had an incredibly strange dream last night. I was in a dream, and then I realized I was dreaming, so I woke up. But then I realized I was still dreaming, so I woke up again. Then I realized I was still dreaming, and I woke up a third time. It was so confusing when I actually woke up for real. 

Has anyone else ever had a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream? How did you handle it?

It's no secret that the current political climate in the United States is in a state of turmoil. From the growing divide between the two major political parties, to the rise of populism, to the growing distrust of the government, it's clear that something needs to change. We need new policies that can bridge the gap between the two sides and restore trust in our government. We need policies that recognize the complexity of our society and the need for compromise. We need policies that focus on the needs of all Americans, not just those of a select few. It's time for a new direction and new policies that can bring us together, not tear us apart.

Hey everyone, 

I'm 22 years old and I'm scared to be left alone in the house because of some drawers. I don't know why, but whenever I'm in the house alone, I get a weird feeling that something is in the drawers. I'm not sure what it is, but I'm scared to open them. 

Has anyone else had this experience before? If so, what did you do about it? I'd really appreciate any advice or tips on how to get over this fear. 

Thanks!

It really bothers me when people put Int heroes into the 'support' category just because they have a high Int stat. I think Int heroes can be played in many different roles, and it's a shame when people don't give them the credit they deserve. 

I'm also really glad that you included Behe as a support hero. He has an Int stat of 5, but he can be played as an initiator, ganker, or even a semi-carry. He has a lot of utility, and I think he deserves to be played as a support.

Accutane is a great medication for treating acne, and it works for the vast majority of people who take it. However, there is a small percentage of people who have had adverse reactions to Accutane. I believe this may be due to the fact that Accutane is a vitamin A derivative, which can be stored in fat cells. This means that if you are overweight, you may be more likely to have a negative reaction to Accutane. While this is just my own theory, it's worth considering if you are considering taking Accutane. It's always best to consult with a doctor before starting any medication, and Accutane is no exception.

It's no secret that many r/atheism posters are hypocrites who are actually part of a religion, whether they realize it or not. They may not consider themselves religious, but they often act like they are. They criticize other religions, yet they often cling to their own beliefs and try to convert others to their own views. They may not call it religion, but it's a form of faith nonetheless. So, r/atheism posters, why do you think you're exempt from the label of "religious"?

"I've been watching the new show 'Big Bang Theory' and I'm really disappointed. As a nerd myself, I find it insulting that the show portrays nerd life in such a shallow and stereotypical way. Raj, the only POC character, is often reduced to a punchline and is rarely given any meaningful characterization. Not to mention the fact that he's also subjected to racism and homophobia. It's like the writers are trying to make a comedy, but they're failing miserably. It's honestly hard to believe that this show was made with any real effort."

"As a nerd myself, I can tell you that we can be a pretty funny group of people!

I just found out I'm not the only person who dislikes Big Bang Theory and I saw an opportunity to vent my distaste of the show. So I did. I made a post on social media about how I think the show is overrated and lacks originality.

"ELI5: What's the difference between a good actor and a great one?

Good actors can memorize their lines and deliver them convincingly. Great actors, on the other hand, go beyond that. They completely inhabit their character and make you believe in their performance. It's a level of dedication and commitment to their craft that sets great actors apart from good ones. 

When you watch a great actor, you don't just accept the character they're playing, you become invested in them. That's the difference between a good actor and a great one."

I hate you Stan. You've been a lifelong Arsenal fan and you still can't see what's wrong with the club. We've had the same problems for years and you still refuse to acknowledge them. We've had terrible management, terrible signings, and terrible tactics. We've had so many chances to turn things around and yet you still remain blindly loyal to the club. I'm sorry Stan, but I just can't take it anymore. I'm done with you and Arsenal. #WengerOut

My parents are baby boomers, but they know what's up. They understand what real oppression is because their parents experienced it firsthand in the concentration camps of the Holocaust. They don't get caught up in the kind of "oppression" that some people talk about, like not being able to teach creationism in school. They know that real oppression involves much more than that.

The Bush administration made deep cuts to revenue and the spending has increased faster than the revenue since then. But it's important to remember that those deep cuts to revenue were a major factor in the current budget situation. The Bush administration's cuts to revenue, combined with the economic recession, have created a budget deficit that has been difficult to overcome. So while it's true that spending has increased faster than revenue, it's important to remember that the Bush administration's deep cuts to revenue set the stage for this situation.

Inflation is a hot topic these days, and it's important to understand the difference between inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and actual inflation in assets. The government has been known to change the definition of CPI to make the numbers appear lower than they actually are, meaning that the real inflation rate is much higher. This has caused a phenomenon known as stagflation, where the costs of goods and services rise while economic growth remains stagnant. So while the official numbers may say there isn't much inflation, the reality is that it's still very much present.

If China decides to dump US bonds, the US will likely see a slight increase in gas prices, but we could also see a surge of manufacturing jobs and a devastating blow to China's economy. The US could benefit from the influx of jobs and the Chinese economy would suffer greatly. It's a risky move for China, but it could pay off in the long run.

If you're just getting into playing guitar, it can be difficult to know what gauge strings you should use. The best way to figure out your preferences is to start with standard sets and work up from there. Standard sets are typically 10-46 gauge, but you can go higher or lower depending on your playing style. Experiment with different gauges to find what works best for you – heavier strings offer more sustain, while lighter strings are easier to play. Don't be afraid to try different gauges to find what works best for you!

Gay men make the best wingmen because they understand the dynamics between men and women better than anyone else.

Whether you're looking for a laugh or a bit of encouragement, having a gay friend around can be the best wingman you could ever have.

It's no secret that anxiety and depression are two of the most common mental health issues people face today. While they may share some similarities, they are also distinct in their own ways. 

Anxiety is about confronting negative expectations and realizing they are often overblown. It can be a fear of failure or a fear of the unknown. It is a feeling of apprehension and unease that can lead to physical symptoms such as sweating, trembling, and difficulty breathing. 

Depression is about confronting negative thought patterns and realizing they are unreasonable. It can be a feeling of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness. It can also lead to physical symptoms such as fatigue, loss of appetite, and difficulty concentrating. 

Both anxiety and depression can be debilitating and can have a serious impact on someone's life. It is important to recognize the differences between the two and to seek help from a mental health professional if needed.

We don't have sex as often as we used to and it's starting to take a toll on our relationship.

It's no surprise that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is often criticized for its representation of the science. While the IPCC does a good job of summarizing the existing scientific literature, the physical processes in the atmosphere are so complex that the scientific community still has a lot to learn.

Rather than presenting the science as if we have a good grasp on things, the IPCC should be emphasizing the scientific community's ignorance. This would help to avoid the impression that the science is settled, when in reality there is still much to be learned.

It's important to recognize that uncertainty is an inherent part of science, and that the IPCC should be communicating this to the public. By emphasizing the scientific community's ignorance, the IPCC can help to avoid unwarranted certainty and ensure that the public is better informed about the state of climate science.

I recently switched from Sam's Club to Costco and I'm so glad I did! Costco has lower prices on so many items and the selection is much better. Plus, I love the convenience of having a Costco near me. 

I also love how Costco has a laundry, snack stash, and chore sheet/chore days. This makes it so much easier to keep track of what needs to be done and how much money I'm spending. Plus, the insurance and clinic make it so much easier to get the medical care I need.

Overall, I'm very happy with my switch to Costco and I would highly recommend it over Sam's Club.

When it comes to insurance, it can be tricky to know what type and how much coverage you need. That's why it's important to consult with an insurance agent.

Consulting with an insurance agent can save you time and money in the long run.

Don't let anyone take advantage of you or your belongings. Be smart and stay safe!

Insurance is an important part of financial planning, but it's important to remember that it's only meant to hedge against large financial risks. Insurance is not meant to be used as a crutch for bad financial decisions. If you're considering purchasing insurance, make sure you understand what risks you're hedging against and that you're comfortable with the cost of the policy. Don't buy insurance just because it's available; make sure it's an appropriate decision for your financial situation.

We often hear people talking about work that is “beneath” them, or that they would never do. But the truth is, there is no job that is beneath someone. Any job that helps you cover your costs and doesn’t hurt others should be embraced and taken seriously.

No matter what type of job you take, you should always strive to do your best and take pride in your work. You never know what opportunities might arise from it, and it’s always better to have a good work ethic than to be seen as someone who only does the bare minimum.

So don’t be ashamed of any job you take. It’s a great way to gain experience and make some money, and it could even lead to something more. Don’t let anyone tell you that you’re “beneath” them or that the job you’re doing is beneath you. Take a job as long as it will help you cover your costs and not hurt others. There is no such thing as work that is below someone.

This post is about the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) and their recent legal battles.

I'm sure many of you are familiar with the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) and their controversial views. Recently, they've been in the news for a variety of reasons, but most notably for their lawsuits and countersuits against various organizations and individuals.

However, it seems that the WBC is more interested in lawsuits and countersuits than in their original mission of protesting funerals, rallies, and other events. It's disheartening to see an organization that was originally founded to spread a message of hate become more focused on legal battles than on their original purpose.

What do you think about the WBC's recent legal activities? Do you think they're wasting their time and resources on lawsuits and countersuits, or do you think it's a necessary part of their mission? Let us know in the comments!

"It's an interesting analogy. I think it applies well to the gaming world. A patch can be used to indicate that a uniform hasn't been used, but it's not a guarantee that it hasn't. Just like a Texas license plate on a car doesn't guarantee that it hasn't ever been to California. It's possible that the uniform has been used, but just not with the patch. Similarly, it's possible that the car has been to California, even if it has a Texas license plate. People should be careful not to assume too much based on one piece of evidence."

As a society, we have to draw a line somewhere when it comes to gun rights. We don't treat any rights as absolute, and we have already drawn an arbitrary line in the sand with guns. We need to make it harder for crazies to get their hands on guns and use them to kill innocent little kids. We need to take a hard look at our gun laws and make sure they are doing what they can to keep our kids safe.

We have too many guns in the US to make a flat-out gun ban work. That's why we need to demand greater responsibility from gun owners. We need to make sure that guns are kept secure and that only responsible people have access to them. We need to make sure that those who own firearms are educated on gun safety and know the laws regarding gun ownership and use. We need to push for better background checks, and for better mental health resources to help those who may be at risk of violence. We need to work together to make sure that guns are used responsibly and safely.

I'm writing this post to apologize to my girlfriend, Erynn. We were both virgins when we started dating, but I lied to her and told her I was no longer a virgin. We had sex for the first time together, and she had no idea that I was lying.

I feel so ashamed and embarrassed for lying to her, and I'm sorry for doing it. I never meant to hurt her, and I hope she can forgive me. I know I can never take back what I did, but I want her to know that I'm sorry.

I love her and I care about her deeply. I hope that one day she can forgive me and understand why I felt the need to lie.

Once again, I'm sorry Erynn.

I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who think that higher refresh rates are more important than higher resolutions when it comes to gaming. But, IMO, higher resolutions are always going to be more important than higher refresh rates. Sure, higher refresh rates can make your games look smoother, but a higher resolution will give you a better overall experience, as you'll be able to see more of the game world. Plus, with higher resolutions, you'll be able to get better performance out of your graphics card, as it won't have to render as many pixels. So, higher resolution > higher refresh rate any day of the week, in my opinion. Edit: Words are hard.

As a high school administrator, I can tell you that I don't have time for the legal complexities of giving minors the same rights as adults. It's a real challenge to figure out the best way to balance the interests of the students and their parents, while also trying to ensure that the school is in compliance with the law. It's a difficult job, and I often have to make decisions that are unpopular with some people. So, when it comes to giving minors the same rights as adults, I'm afraid I just don't have the time or energy to do it.

I'm sure that it will be a great feature to have and I can't wait to get my hands on it.

Hey everyone, 

I'm a big fan of Dota 2 and I've been watching some of the professional teams play recently. One thing I've noticed is that they push really hard on towers. No matter how much Tree tries to defend, they just keep pushing and eventually take the towers down. 

I'm wondering if this is a common strategy among pro teams or if it's just a fluke. Does anyone have any insight on this? Are there any strategies that Tree can use to better defend against these pushes? 

Thanks in advance for any advice!

Hey everyone,

I just got married a few months ago and I wanted to share some advice for anyone planning their own wedding. One thing I did that was really unique and fun was to have my kids play some cool music at the reception.

My kids are all grown up now, but I wanted to make sure they had a special role in our wedding. We had them play some of their favorite songs from their childhood, as well as some of our favorite songs. It was a great way to involve our kids and add a personal touch to the celebration.

If you're looking for a way to make your wedding even more special, I highly suggest having your kids play some cool music. It will make the day even more memorable and add a unique touch of fun.

Happy planning!

This post is about a law enforcement officer (LEO) who was a true professional in handling a situation. From the story, it sounds like a woman had something bad happen to her and the LEO was very understanding and sympathetic.

It's great to see a LEO acting with such professionalism and compassion. It's also a reminder that these situations can be traumatic for the people involved and it's important for them to get the help they need. My suggestion would be to encourage the woman to seek counseling and other forms of support from a qualified professional to help her through this difficult time.

Today I learned that fame is a sexually transmitted disease and she's got a bad case of it. It's incredibly contagious and can spread like wildfire. It seems that the more famous someone becomes, the more people want to be around them and the more their fame grows. It's a vicious cycle that can be hard to break. The only real cure is to take a step back from the spotlight and try to live a more normal life. Unfortunately, for some, this isn't always an option.

"I've always found it interesting that Nickelback is essentially pop music, but they don't try to hide it. They embrace it and make it their own. It's refreshing to see a band that doesn't pretend to be something they're not. What do you think of Nickelback's approach to making music?"

Making sure your resume is concise and focused is key to standing out from the crowd. It's easy to get bogged down in "fluffy" language and phrases, but it's important to be aware of how you're being perceived. Just because that's "simply how you write" doesn't mean it's not fluffy. It's not about what HR wants - it's about conveying your experience in a way that is clear and concise. 

Focus on using action-oriented language that highlights your accomplishments and experience. Use active verbs and avoid using the same words over and over. Make sure your resume is tailored to the job you're applying for and that it reflects your unique skills and experience. 

Remember, it's not about what HR wants - it's about how you present yourself. Being aware of how you're being perceived is key to standing out from the crowd and getting the job you want.

Hey everyone,

I'm in a bit of a sticky situation and I'm looking for some advice.

Basically, my girlfriend can be a bit jealous sometimes and it's starting to really affect our relationship. She's always accusing me of talking to other girls and it's just really exhausting. I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around her.

I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to be a doormat and just accept her behavior, but I also don't want to be a jerk and just break up with her.

Any advice on how to handle this situation?

Thanks!

As an astrophysicist, I'm curious about the rate at which our Sun burns compared to the massive stars that produce supernovae. It's clear that our Sun is much slower in burning its fuel than these stars, yet it is believed that these supernovae played a major role in creating the heavy elements in our solar system. Can anyone explain why this is the case, or provide any insight into how supernovae could have created the heavy elements in our solar system?

ELI5: Even if it doesn't map directly to physical space, sometimes abstract concepts are useful in truly unexpected places. 

Abstract concepts are ideas that don't have a physical representation. For example, the concept of love isn't something you can touch or see, but it's still an important part of our lives. 

Abstract concepts can be useful in unexpected places, like when scientists are trying to understand how certain things work. For example, when scientists were trying to figure out why some particles behave differently than others, they used the concept of energy. Energy is an abstract concept, but it helped them understand why particles behave the way they do. 

Abstract concepts can also be useful when making decisions. For example, when deciding which job to take, you might consider the concept of job satisfaction. Job satisfaction is an abstract concept, but it can help you decide which job is best for you. 

So even though abstract concepts don't have a physical representation, they can still be useful in unexpected places.

A tesseract is the 4D equivalent of a cube. Think of a cube as a 3D square. We can look at it from different angles, and it has length, width, and height. A tesseract is the 4D version of a cube. It has length, width, height, and a fourth dimension. So if you imagine a cube, and then imagine that it has a fourth dimension, that's a tesseract. It's like a cube, but with an extra dimension.

It's a common misconception that GHz is the most important factor when it comes to choosing a processor. While it's true that higher GHz means higher performance, it's not the only factor to consider.

When it comes to choosing a processor, benchmarks are the best way to measure performance. Benchmarks measure how well a processor performs in various tasks, such as gaming, video editing, and more. This allows you to compare processors of different GHz and make an informed decision about which one is best for your needs.

So remember, when it comes to choosing a processor, GHz means nothing. Benchmarks means everything.

Today I F'd Up.

I was bored and decided to see if I could make a magnetic dildo. I had some rare earth magnets lying around so I thought I'd give it a shot. I stuck 74 magnets up my dick, and I'm not sure I'd advise anyone else to do the same.

It was an incredibly painful experience and I had to go to the hospital to get the magnets removed. They had to use a special tool to do it, and I'm still sore from the experience.

Lesson learned: don't stick magnets up your dick.

TIFU by falling asleep after masturbating to porn and my roommate came to wake me up, catching a full view of my bare ass and vagina as well as fetish lesbian porn on the laptop next to my face. We are pretending it didn't happen.

It was a pretty awkward situation. I had just finished masturbating and was about to clean up when I fell asleep. I guess I was just too tired to move. When I woke up, my roommate was standing there, looking at me with a horrified expression. I quickly grabbed a blanket to cover myself up and pretended like nothing happened.

My roommate and I haven't talked about it since, but I'm sure he's still thinking about it. I'm really embarrassed and I'm doing my best to avoid him. I just hope that he can forget about it and that we can still be friends.
|


Today I TIFU by Dutch ovening myself with some curry I had made earlier today. I was so proud of my dish and couldn't wait to dig in, but the smell of the curry was too much for me and I ended up barfing all over the kitchen. 

I'm also probably never going to go to the jungle or eat ice cream again. I'm sure the smell of the curry would bring back all the wrong memories. 

Lesson learned: Don't get too excited about cooking and always keep the windows open when cooking something with a strong smell.
|


Today I TIFU by accidentally spilling my entire cup of coffee all over my lap.

It all started when I was getting ready to leave for work. I had my coffee cup in my hand and was trying to get my keys out of my pocket. Unfortunately, my thumb slipped off the cup and it tipped over, spilling its contents all over my lap. 

Everything was dripping - my shirt, my pants, my shoes. It was a mess. I had to run back inside and change my clothes, but not before the coffee had stained my shirt and pants.

I'm still trying to get the coffee stains out of my clothes, but I think I'm going to have to throw them out. 

Lesson learned: don't carry your coffee cup and your keys at the same time!

I'm a fucking moron.

Today I was supposed to pick up my sister from the airport and I completely forgot. She had to take a bus home, and she was so mad at me. I feel like the worst sister ever.

I don't know how I could have forgotten something so important. I'm usually very organized, so this is totally out of character for me.

I'm so embarrassed and ashamed of myself. I'm going to make it up to her, but I feel like I can never make up for this mistake.

TL;DR: I forgot to pick up my sister from the airport and she had to take a bus home. I feel like the worst sister ever.

I was at the bus stop this morning waiting to get to school and this crazy woman was there too. She was screaming and cursing about how there weren't enough bike racks on the bus, and she was getting really mad. She started shaking the bike racks, and then she grabbed one of the students and started shaking him too. Everyone was scared and trying to get away from her, but she wouldn't let go. Eventually the bus driver came over and got her to let go, but it was really scary. I'm glad no one got hurt, but it was a close call. It's crazy how people can get so worked up over something like not having enough bike racks on the bus.

If you're just starting out in League of Legends, it can be hard to know which champion to pick. If you want to play aggressively and get kills early on, then Caitlyn is a great choice. She has a long range and high damage output, making her great for getting the early advantage. On the other hand, if you want to play a bit more passively and farm up, then Vayne is a great option. She has a lot of mobility and can easily avoid ganks, while also having decent damage output. So if you're just starting out, it can be helpful to know which champion to pick depending on your playstyle.

"I recently had an issue with an assistant at work. He was crossing the line with me, making inappropriate comments and gestures. I was uncomfortable and unsure of how to handle the situation. I eventually spoke to my supervisor about it, but I'm still not sure if I did the right thing.

Has anyone else had a similar experience? How did you handle it?"

I recently reconnected with an old acquaintance of mine after not seeing him in years. He seemed to be doing well, so I thought nothing of it. 

However, a few days ago, he randomly showed up at my house and my work uninvited and unannounced. He was clearly distressed, and I was worried about him. He kept talking about how he was feeling lost and alone, and I was afraid he might hurt himself. 

I couldn't just tell him to leave and didn't want to make him feel worse, so I tried to talk to him and be there for him. I eventually managed to get him to leave, but I'm still worried about him. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar? What did you do in this situation?

My exgirlfriend and I broke up a few months ago, but it turns out she had already moved on to another guy. For the next few months, she was constantly stalking me, and then one day she threatened to kill two of my friends. I haven't seen her since then, but I heard from some mutual friends that she's now living with her mom and believes she can fly. Her dogs apparently have seen her fly, which just goes to show how dangerous acid can be. I can only hope that she gets the help she needs. 
Edit: To clarify, I never had any relationships with either of the girls my exgirlfriend was seeing. Sorry for any typos, I'm typing this on an iPad.

"So this happened to me in high school. The most popular guy in school asked me out and I rejected him. He didn't take it too well and started following me around and annoying my boyfriend. It got to the point where my boyfriend had to confront him and tell him to back off. It was really uncomfortable and I felt really embarrassed that he was so persistent even after I said no. Has anyone else had a similar experience?"

I never stuck my D in crazy, she becomes obsessed over the fact, stalks me for about 8 years.

It all started with a simple one night stand. We had a great time and I thought that was the end of it. Little did I know, she became obsessed with me and started stalking me. She would show up at my house unannounced, call me constantly, and send me gifts. I tried to be nice and let her down gently, but she just wouldn't take no for an answer.

It got to the point where I had to get a restraining order against her. Even after that, she would find ways to contact me. It was a nightmare that lasted for 8 years. I'm glad it's finally over, but I still feel a little uneasy when I think about it. Has anyone else gone through a similar experience?

"My partner's ex is crazy in ways I only thought existed in the movies. She has threatened to show up at our house, has called me names and has even sent me threatening messages.

People are douchebags and this guy is no worse than those who would ding a car and leave without leaving a note. I know someone reading this has done it, and you're worse than this guy.

This picture was taken in a parking lot in Tampa, Florida. The man in the picture took the time to write a note on a napkin and leave it on the car that he had accidentally dinged. He was apologetic and even included his phone number in case the owner wanted to contact him.

This small act of kindness is a reminder that not everyone is a douchebag, and that there are still people out there who are willing to do the right thing.

"So I was browsing Reddit the other day and I stumbled across this new subreddit that had been given a face lift and had all regulations removed. I was surprised to see that it was gaining a lot of traction with female users! I'm not sure why it's so popular, but it's definitely a good thing. 

On a side note, I don't know anyone who is into Pinterest that isn't in a relationship. Maybe that's part of the reason why this subreddit is so popular with women? Either way, it's nice to see something that is gaining popularity with a different demographic than the usual Reddit crowd."

It's been over twenty years since the release of the original Pokemon Red and Blue versions. Despite being one of the most beloved gaming franchises of all time, the first two games weren't perfect. In particular, the HM system was often criticized for being overly tedious and restrictive. 

However, despite its flaws, it was the first Pokemon game and deserves some slack. It was the first game to introduce us to the world of Pokemon and its characters, and helped define the series for years to come. 

It's easy to take for granted the innovations that Red and Blue brought us, but it's important to remember that the games laid the foundation for the rest of the franchise. So let's show HM01 some love and give it some slack.

Today I learned that birds are actually dinosaurs and, as such, are reptiles. However, mammals are not reptiles. This means that birds are the only living dinosaurs that we know of! It's amazing to think that the modern birds we see around us are actually the descendants of the giant reptiles that once roamed the Earth.

I remember it like it was yesterday. I was in my dorm room, and I had a bag of Reese's. I had been eating them for days, and I was feeling sick. I knew I had to stop, but I just couldn't. I kept eating until I ODed on Reese's.

It was a wake-up call. I realized that I had a problem, and I needed help. I got help and I've been clean for a year now. I'm proud of myself for taking the steps to get healthy, and I'm grateful for the support of my friends and family.

This experience has taught me that I can't let myself get too comfortable, and that I need to be mindful of my health. I'm so glad I was able to turn my life around and get back on track.

I recently decided to try a vegetarian diet and went out to dinner with some friends. They all ordered red meat, but I got the chicken and fish. The chicken was really bad, but the fish was fine. I was really hesitant to try red meat, but after my experience with the chicken I didn't want to give it a chance. Has anyone else had a similar experience?

I think it's so important to practice safe sex, especially in this day and age. We all know the risks of unprotected sex, and it's important to take the necessary precautions to prevent any unwanted consequences. But I think it's also important to remember to enjoy sex, and not just use it as a way to get rid of a pimple or something. Sex should be an enjoyable experience, and it's important to be aware of the risks and to take the necessary steps to protect yourself and your partner. So just be careful, use protection, and try to do it to enjoy it, not to get rid of a pimple.

Hey everyone,

I'm sure many of us have seen the phrase "Yes, Dear" guy, referring to a guy who is always agreeable and never stands up for himself. I'm sure that some of us have been that guy at some point in our lives, and I'm sure many of us have been on the receiving end of it.

So my question is, what are some tips for avoiding becoming the "Yes, Dear" guy? How can we stand up for ourselves and assert our opinions without coming off as aggressive?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Exercise is known to cause inflammation, but how is this different from chronic inflammatory responses that may affect mood?

Exercise-induced inflammation is a normal and beneficial consequence of physical activity. It is a short-term response to the physical stress of exercise that helps the body to repair and strengthen muscles and other tissues. Exercise-induced inflammation is characterized by a localized increase in blood flow, an increase in the number of white blood cells, and the release of hormones and other substances that help to restore the body to its pre-exercise state.

Chronic inflammation, on the other hand, is a long-term response to an ongoing stimulus. It is characterized by an increase in the number of white blood cells and the release of hormones and other substances that can cause damage to the body. Chronic inflammation is linked to a number of different conditions, including depression and anxiety.

The difference between exercise-induced inflammation and chronic inflammation is that the former is a normal and beneficial response to physical stress while the latter is a long-term response to an ongoing stimulus. Exercise-induced inflammation helps the body to repair and strengthen muscles and other tissues, while chronic inflammation can lead to damage to the body and may be associated with various conditions.

I'm a long-time Star Trek fan, so I'm used to the idea that the franchise has had its ups and downs. But lately, it seems like there's been a huge influx of new fans, and I think that might be the problem. 

But that's not necessarily a bad thing. New fans bring new perspectives, new interpretations, and new ideas. They also bring a sense of energy and enthusiasm that can help keep the franchise alive. And if they're passionate enough, they might even help to create a new generation of Star Trek fans. 

So while I may not always agree with the opinions of these new fans, I do think that their presence is a good thing for Star Trek. After all, without them, the franchise might not even still be around.

Hi everyone, 

I'm a 20 year old female and I've had gratification disorder (AKA infantile masturbation or benign idiopathic infantile dyskinesia) since I was a baby. I've been masturbating for as long as I can remember and I'm feeling really embarrassed and ashamed about it. I'm also worried that it's going to affect my relationships and sex life in the future. 

I was wondering if anyone else has had this condition and how they've managed to cope with it. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you!

I had a customer call in today who was having an issue with their printer. After troubleshooting it for a while, I realized that the issue was due to a missing part. I told the customer that the part was not covered by the warranty and that they would need to purchase it.

The customer asked how much it would cost, and I told him honestly that it would be about $50. He thanked me for being honest and said he would look into purchasing the part elsewhere.

It's nice to know that honesty is still appreciated in this day and age.

We all have different beliefs and opinions, and it can be hard to decide what is the right thing to do in any given situation. That's why I think it's important to remember that each situation is different and that it's okay to do what you feel is right. We all have our own unique perspectives and experiences that can inform our decisions, and it's important to recognize that and trust your own judgement. No one else can tell you what the right thing to do is, so don't be afraid to make decisions based on what you feel is right.

Hey everyone, 

I'm sure many of us are trying to lose weight and it can be really difficult. I'm here to share with you some tips that have been helping me in my journey. 

First, tracking your calories is essential. There are many great apps like MyFitnessPal.com that make it easier to keep track of what you're eating. This also helps you to be more mindful of your caloric intake. 

Second, try to avoid drinking your calories. Sugary drinks like soda and juices can add up quickly. Instead, try to drink more water or unsweetened tea. 

Third, try some new healthy foods. You may be surprised at how low in calories some of these foods are. For example, salsa is surprisingly low in calories for the flavor. 

Fourth, celebrate your wins. Even if you have a bad day, don't be too hard on yourself. It's natural to have ups and downs in your journey. 

I hope these tips are helpful to you. Good luck on your journey!

If you find yourself in a situation where you're feeling like you need to binge on food, try to make healthier choices by binging on fruits and vegetables instead. Fruits and vegetables contain essential vitamins and minerals that are important for your overall health and can help curb cravings. Plus, they're lower in calories than many other snacks and will help you reach your health and weight loss goals. So if you have to binge, make sure it's on healthy, nutritious options like fruits and vegetables.

I chewed ice for a looooong time and discovered I was severely iron deficient. I was so surprised at how much of an impact it had on my health. I had been feeling sluggish, exhausted, and just generally not feeling well for a while and I had no idea why.

I went to the doctor and they ran some tests and found out I was severely iron deficient. I was shocked. I had no idea that my ice chewing habit was the cause of my issues.

I’ve since stopped chewing ice and started taking iron supplements. I’m feeling much better now and I’m so glad I finally figured out the problem.

Has anyone else had a similar experience?

"I recently watched a documentary about a scientific exploration of the origins of religion. It started off with a lot of promise, exploring the various theories and evidence behind the development of religious beliefs. Unfortunately, as the documentary progressed, it seemed to become less focused on the scientific and scholarly aspects of the topic and more focused on the religious aspects. By the end of the documentary, it seemed that the religious perspective had taken precedence over the scientific and scholarly one.

Overall, I thought it was an interesting documentary, but I was a bit disappointed that it didn't stay true to its original scientific and scholarly focus. Has anyone else seen this documentary and noticed the same thing?"

I recently got my hands on an old straight razor and have been using it to shave my face. I have to say, it's much nicer to shave with than a shavette. The straight razor gives me a much closer shave and is much more comfortable to use. Plus, it's just a beautiful piece of craftsmanship. 

If you're thinking of getting into straight razor shaving, I'd highly recommend it. It's worth the investment of time and money to restore an old straight razor and use it to shave. It's a great way to get a close shave and appreciate the beauty of a finely crafted tool.

Hey everyone,

I recently discovered a new way to make a delicious dish that I wanted to share. It's a simple but tasty way to make a meal out of almost anything.

Basically, you take whatever ingredients you want to use, stuff it with breadcrumbs, drizzle with olive oil, and then pressure cook it. The result is a flavorful and juicy dish that's sure to please.

I've been experimenting with different ingredients, like chicken, beef, and fish, and it works great with all of them. The breadcrumbs give it a nice crunch and the olive oil adds a nice flavor.

I'm sure you can come up with some creative variations on this recipe, so give it a try and let me know what you think.

Thanks!

Hey everyone,

I'm a 2L at a top 10 law school and I wanted to share some advice for those of you who are considering law school or who have already started.

First, know your stuff. Law school is hard and you need to be prepared. Make sure you understand the material and have a good grasp of the law.

Second, work during your summers. Law school is a great opportunity to gain experience and make connections. Working during the summer is a great way to do that.

Third, make sure you do good (and clear) work. Law school is all about the details. Make sure you pay attention to the details and make sure your work is clear and understandable.

I hope this advice helps. Good luck!

Google Products Liability, Manufacturing Defects

It's been revealed that Google has been dealing with a major issue in regards to its products liability and manufacturing defects. Reports have come out that the company has been facing a lot of lawsuits over the past few years due to the fact that their products have been found to be defective. This has caused a lot of financial losses for the company as well as a lot of bad publicity.

Google has been trying to address the issue by taking steps to improve their product quality and safety. They have implemented a number of measures such as increased testing, improved inspection and quality control procedures, and better customer service. However, it seems that this has not been enough to stop the lawsuits from coming in.

It's clear that Google needs to take further action to address this issue and ensure that their products are safe and free from defects. This is an important issue for the company, as it can have a huge impact on their reputation and bottom line. It's time for Google to step up and take responsibility for their products and ensure that their customers are safe.

It's no secret that the Chicago Bears and Chicago Cubs share a lot of the same fan base. While there are exceptions, the correlation between the two fan bases is high enough to accurately say that they have pretty much the same fan base. Whether it's at a game, in the stands, or watching from home, there's no denying that Bears and Cubs fans alike are passionate about their teams. So, if you're a Bears or Cubs fan, you can cheer on both teams with plenty of FIBs (fans in blue). Go Bears! Go Cubs!

"Have you ever heard of hackers? They’re people who use their knowledge of computers and programming to exploit weaknesses in computer security and take advantage of people who don't understand how computers and networks work. They can do things like steal data, gain access to confidential information, or even take control of a computer system. It’s important to be aware of how hackers operate and how to protect yourself from them."

ELI5: Hacking is when someone uses their knowledge of computers and technology to break into a computer system or network without permission. It can involve breaking into computers, changing or deleting data, or manipulating a system to do something it was not designed to do. Hackers can also use their knowledge to spread viruses or malware, which can disrupt communication and cause computers to behave in unexpected ways.

Hey everyone, 

I recently had a discussion with someone about BIOS passwords and why they can't be reset. My argument was that, since the BIOS is stored on a chip on the motherboard, it's impossible to reset the password without physically replacing the chip. 

Using a USB flash drive to boot won't work either, since the BIOS password is required to access the boot menu. The post never mentioned having a bootable CD/DVD either, so that's not an option. 

Bottom line, if you forget your BIOS password, you'll need to replace the motherboard to get back in. 

Hope this helps!

ELI5: Hacking advice on Reddit can get your MMO account banned.

Basically, if you post on Reddit asking for advice on how to hack into an MMO account, the game developers will see it and can ban your account. This is because posting advice on how to cheat or hack into an account is against the terms of service of most online games. So, if you want to keep your account safe, don't post about hacking on Reddit.

Hey everyone! 

So, some hackers use a combination of malicious software, known as a trojan horse, to gain access to your computer and steal information. A trojan horse is a type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate program or file. It can be used to install other malicious software or spy on your activities. 

Basically, the hacker will send you a seemingly harmless file, like a game or a document, but it actually contains malicious code that will install other malicious software on your computer. This software can be used to steal your passwords or other sensitive information. 

So be careful when downloading files from the internet, and make sure you have a good antivirus program installed on your computer! 

Hope that helps explain it!

ELI5: Some people use their knowledge of computers and programming to take advantage of people who don't understand technology very well, or don't have good security measures in place. This might include stealing money or personal information, or using someone else's computer to do something illegal.
|


ELI5: How do hackers exploit people and technology?

Hackers are people who use their knowledge of computers and programming to exploit weaknesses in computer systems and networks. They take advantage of people who don't know enough about security and technology, or who have made mistakes when setting up their systems. They also use their knowledge of computers and programming to find vulnerabilities in systems and networks that they can exploit. Once they have access to a system, they can do things like steal data, install malicious software, or even take control of the system.

Hey everyone,

Today I want to talk about the importance of practicing your frame advantage after a step kick following a standing light kick. After a successful step kick, you're at frame advantage, so you should be looking to capitalize on it. One of the best ways to do this is to work on the 1f link (step kick >> st. hp). This is a great way to keep your opponent guessing and can lead to some big damage if done correctly.

Once you've landed the step kick, you can also press your advantage after a falling sky (hard knockdown). This is a great way to stay on the offensive and keep your opponent guessing. It also gives you a chance to set up a mix-up or a combo.

So, if you want to get better at SF4, keep practicing this frame advantage after a successful step kick. It's a great way to stay on the offensive and keep your opponent guessing. Good luck!

I've worked on being able to read people's emotions, facial expressions and body language, but not everyone possesses the ability. If you want to gain this skill, I highly recommend reading books by Paul Ekman, especially Unmasking the Face. However, be careful with this ability if you do possess it. It can hurt more than help if you don't use it with care.

Hey everyone!

If you're looking for a great place to start with anime, I highly recommend checking out the original compilation movies from the classic series. You can start with Mobile Suit Gundam, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, and Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ. After that, I'd suggest watching Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team. It's a great show that follows a team of pilots as they fight to protect Earth from the Zeon forces.

The original compilation movies and The 08th MS Team are great starting points for anyone looking to get into anime. The stories are engaging, the characters are memorable, and the animation is top-notch. Plus, the original compilation movies are a great way to get a feel for the entire Gundam universe. So, if you're looking for a great place to start, give the original compilation movies and The 08th MS Team a try!

I've been living in downtown Cincinnati for about a year now, and I absolutely love it. I'm not a suburb-hater by any means, but I think that living downtown in the city really makes Cincinnati seem so much better. It's just so vibrant and alive, and there's always something to do. Plus, the views of the river and the skyline are amazing. I'm so glad I made the move to the city, and I'm sure I'll be here for a long time!

Hey everyone, 

I'm trying to decide if I should add Paradox Plaza games to Steam, play them in tab out or windowed mode, or just stick with playing them on the Paradox Plaza. What do you think? 

I'm leaning towards adding them to Steam, as it seems to be the most convenient option and I'd like to keep all my games in one place. But I'm also worried that it might not be as enjoyable as playing them on the Paradox Plaza. 

What do you think? What are the pros and cons of each option? 

Thanks for your input!

I know it can be really hard to trust your partner, especially when it comes to their friendships with the opposite sex. From my experience I can say 99% sure nothing happened because you're in a relationship and friends respect that. She's just trying to protect you from your own anxiety and make sure that you're not worrying unnecessarily. 

However, I may be wrong and it's important to talk it out with her. It's important to be open and honest with each other in a relationship and to be able to communicate your feelings. If you're feeling anxious and suspicious, it's better to talk it out and get to the bottom of it rather than letting it fester and build up.

Bottom Line, we need to educate our kids, not just about guns, but in general. We need to create an environment where our children want to go to school, feel safe and happy there, and are motivated to become something. Removing violent video games isn't going to get us there, in my opinion. We need to focus on creating a positive learning environment, one that encourages our children to think critically, to ask questions, and to be creative. We need to provide our children with the tools and resources to help them succeed. We need to provide them with the support and guidance they need to reach their full potential. That's the bottom line.

I'm sure this isn't the typical post you'd find on r/pics, but I wanted to share this hilarious story.

So I was researching "Anal Fissures" on my laptop the other day, convinced I had one. Little did I know, my brother had been watching me the whole time.

Fast forward to my 21st birthday party, and my brother decides to share with the whole room what I had been researching. I was so embarrassed, but the whole room was in hysterics.

I guess the moral of the story is: always be aware of your surroundings!

Has anyone else ever had a similar embarrassing experience?

It's amazing how fast you can get dehydrated. We often take for granted how much water our bodies need to function correctly. Even a small amount of dehydration can have a huge impact on our physical and mental performance.

Make sure to drink plenty of water and other fluids to keep your body functioning at its best.

I can't believe it happened to me. Last week I was walking around campus, minding my own business, when I suddenly felt a wave of nausea come over me. I barely made it to the bathroom before I started vomiting. It was a never-ending cycle of neon pink vomit that just kept coming. I was like a vomit tornado! 

It turns out I had been infected with the norovirus. I had no idea that this virus could cause such extreme symptoms. I was so dehydrated from all the vomiting that I had to be hospitalized. 

After a few days of IV fluids and rest, I'm feeling much better. I'm still amazed at how quickly the norovirus can turn you into a vomit tornado. I'm definitely going to be a lot more careful about washing my hands and avoiding contact with anyone who is sick.
|


We're driving down the road, vomit's spraying all around... and I'm in the passenger seat, wondering what the heck is going on. Turns out, a new study has found that cars may actually be making us sick. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have discovered that the air inside a car can contain up to 10 times more bacteria than the air outside. This includes bacteria that can cause food poisoning, respiratory infections, and even the flu. So if you're feeling a bit queasy while driving, you may want to crack a window!
|


If you suspect you have norovirus, don't suffer through it. Going to the hospital is the best way to get proper treatment and avoid the worst of the symptoms. Norovirus is highly contagious and can cause severe dehydration, vomiting, and diarrhea. It's not something to take lightly, and if you can afford to go to the hospital, do it. Trust me, you will seriously want to wish death upon yourself if you try to tough it out. No joke.

"I don't know about you, but when I step on a Lego, I can't help but let out a few choice words. It's like a reflex. But I also feel guilty about it, like I'm disrespecting the Lego.

Do you think there's something wrong with overusing curses when you step on Legos?"

I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria a few years ago, and I've been on a long journey of self-acceptance and understanding. After a lot of hard work, I can confidently say that I no longer feel the same level of dysphoria that I used to.

"This person is wrong. There is not one single definition of a man, and it is wrong to deny the identity of transmen. Transmen are men, and they deserve to be treated as such.

My family recently had an incident where a young kid vandalized our house. We were able to catch him in the act and I immediately flipped out on him. The kid was unapologetic and I was so angry that I nearly got arrested for intimidation and blasphemy.

"It's been a few weeks since the Canadian government announced a ban on certain types of assault-style weapons. I'm sure everyone has their own opinion on the matter, but it seems like the government has overstepped their bounds in this case.

Many Canadians already had their own laws and regulations in place to control the sale and use of firearms, and while the government's intentions may have been good, I think they should have left it up to the provinces and territories to decide what was best for their own citizens.

Everyone (including the government probably) would have been perfectly happy if the government didn't shove their nose into this. It's not like the ban was going to make a huge difference in the grand scheme of things. It's just another example of the government trying to control something they don't understand, and it's a shame that it has to be this way."

Seconding should not be sequential. It should be random. If you have a motion to vote on, each person should have an equal chance to second the motion. This way, the motion can be brought to a vote faster and the discussion can move forward. This also prevents one person from dominating the conversation by seconding every motion.

Duncan is definitely not the best professor I've ever had. He's always late to class and he doesn't really explain the material very well. The other day, he assigned us a paper-mache project and didn't tell us how long it would take to dry. I was surprised to find out that it takes several days for it to fully dry. I guess I should have done some research first, but I was expecting it to be a quick project. I'm not sure if I'm going to get a good grade on this project, but at least I learned something!

It's been a long time since the original content from the College Football subreddit has been posted. It's been over a year since the last post and the subreddit has become a ghost town. I know a lot of people have moved on to other subreddits, but I still check in every once in a while to see if there's any new content. It's a shame that the original content is gone, but I'm glad that some of us still come back to check in and see what's going on.

Who is the real Chip Kelly?

Chip Kelly is one of the most enigmatic figures in college football. He is a man of many faces, having been a successful head coach at Oregon, a failed NFL coach with the Philadelphia Eagles, and most recently the head coach of UCLA. So who is the real Chip Kelly? Is he the innovative offensive mastermind who revolutionized college football with his fast-paced offense? Or is he the stubborn, rule-breaking coach whose teams were often plagued by off-field issues?

The answer may lie somewhere in the middle. Chip Kelly is a creative, risk-taking coach who is willing to push the boundaries of the game. He is also a passionate leader who cares deeply about his players and their success. Ultimately, Chip Kelly is a complicated figure whose legacy will be determined by his future accomplishments.

When downloading games from Steam, I've noticed a strange quirk when files already exist in the folder. Instead of overwriting the existing files, Steam will create a new folder with the same name as the game and download all the files into it. This can create a lot of clutter if you're not careful, so I recommend always checking the folder before downloading a game to make sure the files are in the right place.

Police are not necessarily bad, but I would rather have rules set up so that citizens can protect themselves if they so choose. The police are there to enforce the law and keep us safe, but in some cases, they can be overzealous and even oppressive. I think it is important to have a system in place that allows citizens to protect themselves, while still having the police available to handle more serious matters. This way, citizens can be empowered to take charge of their own safety, while still having the police there to help if needed.

Hey everyone, 

I'm sure many of you have seen the recent trend of long titles on Reddit posts. You know, the ones that are so long they take up the entire title space? Well, I have to admit, they look awesome! 

However, I'm with camillabok on this one. Why wait for tomorrow or the next day to start something new? Why not start today? 

Keto is a lifestyle change and it's not something that you can just pick up and do overnight. It takes commitment and dedication to get the results you want. So why wait? Start today and set yourself up for success! 

What do you think? Do you agree with camillabok? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below!

One Piece has been around for a long time, and when it first started it wasn't quite as popular as it is now. Back then, the show was seen as too edgy and not quite family-friendly enough. This isn't the case anymore however, and the biggest thing keeping people from watching One Piece now it seems is the length. The show has over 900 episodes and counting, and with such a long run it can be daunting for new viewers to get into it. But if you're willing to invest the time, One Piece has some of the best, most engaging stories and characters in any anime. So if you're looking for something to watch, give One Piece a chance and you won't be disappointed.

I'm so excited to share my story with you all! My husband and I had been discussing the possibility of having a baby for a while, but we hadn't made any real decisions. We were both in agreement that we didn't want to "try" to get pregnant until we were both ready. 

One night, my husband turned to me and said "Do me a favor, get pregnant." I was shocked, but I knew immediately that this was the sign we had been waiting for. We stopped using birth control right away, and I'm happy to say that I'm now 8 weeks pregnant! 

I'm so excited to be on this journey with my husband, and I'm looking forward to meeting our little bundle of joy in the near future!

Hey everyone,

I've been playing League of Legends for a while now, and I've been in a couple of situations where I was faced with a bruiser coming my way with his teammates right behind him. I know it's tempting to flash away and try to get out of the situation, but I've found that it's often better to stay and fight the bruiser.

When you flash away, it gives his teammates a chance to catch up and join in on the fight. This can be disastrous, especially if they have crowd control abilities or burst damage that can take you down quickly.

On the other hand, if you stay and fight the bruiser, you can often take him down before his teammates can catch up. This gives you a chance to disengage or reposition yourself for the next fight.

So, if you're ever faced with a bruiser heading your way with his teammates closer, don't flash away. Stay and fight the bruiser and you'll often come out on top!

Hey everyone,

I'm sure many of you have had the same experience as me, where you're playing a game of League of Legends and you feel like you're not playing to your full potential. I'm here to offer some tips on how to maximize your utility in game and make sure you're playing at your best.

First and foremost, if your composition has a lot of crowd control, it's a good idea to run Cleanse. This will help you avoid being locked down by the enemy team and give you more opportunities to use your skills to your advantage.

Next, pay attention to key cooldowns on both your team and the enemy team. Knowing when certain abilities are down can be a huge advantage, so make sure you're keeping track of them.

Finally, be aware of the damage potential of the enemy team and try to position yourself accordingly. Be careful not to put yourself in a situation where you're taking too much aggro, and always have an escape plan in mind in case things go south.

I hope these tips help you all become better players and make sure you're playing to your full potential. Good luck!

"I recently had an argument with a friend about the meaning of history. He said that history is just a series of facts that happened in the past, and that it can't be changed. I argued that it depends on the history and the historian.

History isn't just a series of facts, it's also the interpretation of those facts. It's the story that the historian tells us. Different historians can tell different stories, and it's up to us to decide which one is the most accurate.

What do you think? Is history just a series of facts, or is it more complex than that?"

The scale of electric energy is just too much greater than the scale of kinetic energy. You simply can't harvest grid-level waste energy from human kinetic energy. 

Electric energy is measured in kilowatts (kW) or megawatts (MW) and kinetic energy is measured in joules (J). The difference between these two scales is vast. For example, 1 kW is equal to 1,000,000 J. This means that in order to harvest the same amount of energy from a human, you would need to generate 1,000,000 J of kinetic energy. This is an incredibly difficult task as it would require a person to run for hours or days to generate enough energy to make a difference. 

The only way to realistically harvest grid-level waste energy from human kinetic energy is to use renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower. These sources are much more efficient at generating energy and can be used to power homes, businesses, and even entire cities. 

Thanks to these renewable sources, we can now harvest grid-level waste energy from human kinetic energy. This energy can be used to power homes and businesses, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and helping to protect the environment.

This is a really interesting question! The Romans did not have a paper archive because they wrote on perishable materials, such as papyrus and parchment. Papyrus was made from the pith of the papyrus plant, which was abundant in the Mediterranean area. It was a cheap and readily available writing material, but it was not very durable and would not last for centuries. Parchment was made from animal skins and was more durable, but it was also expensive and not widely available.

The Romans also used wax tablets, which were made of wood covered with wax. These tablets could be reused by smoothing the wax with a stylus and writing again. However, these tablets were not suitable for archiving, as the wax would eventually wear away.

The Romans did not have a paper archive because of the perishable materials they used for writing. However, they did have a system of laws and decrees which were recorded on stone or bronze tablets. These tablets were much more durable and could last for centuries, so they served as a kind of archive.

Hey everyone,

If you're looking to climb the ranks in League of Legends, you should know that the higher you get, the more people know how to counter Eve. Eve is mostly banned in higher elo games, so it's important to start learning other OP heroes to stay ahead of the competition.

Some great heroes to pick up are Ezreal, Yasuo, and Jhin, who all have strong laning phases and can carry games if played properly. I also recommend learning how to play champions like Jax, Akali, and Xin Zhao, who all have strong early game pressure and can help you gain an advantage in the early game.

Good luck on your climb!

Hey everyone, 

I've been vegan for a few months now and I'm all for it, but I'm having a hard time finding a balance between being an ethical vegan and a healthy vegan. I'm all for following a plant-based diet but I'm also guilty of eating a lot of processed vegan food and not enough fresh fruits and vegetables. I'm also not very active, so I'm not getting the right amount of nutrients.

I know that a lot of people in the vegan community strive for a balance between the two, but I'm having a hard time finding it. Any tips or advice on how to find that balance between ethical veganism and healthy veganism?

I remember when I first joined the Air Force, I was so excited to be a part of something bigger than myself. I was ready for the challenge and the adventure. But then I got to my first duty station and I realized that it wasn't as glamorous as I had thought. The reality of the situation was that it was hard work and it was tough. I had to learn to accept that things weren't going to be as easy as I had imagined.

It was a tough lesson to learn, but it was a valuable one. I realized that sometimes, the things we think are going to be the most amazing, turn out to be the most challenging. But I also learned that the challenge was what made it so rewarding. I wouldn't trade my experience in the Air Force for anything.

I recently had an issue with some of my brass cases getting stuck in the chamber after shooting steel cases. After doing some research, I found out that this could be due to the fact that I was shooting brass cases after shooting steel cases. Steel cases are harder than brass cases, so when the brass cases are fired after the steel cases, the brass cases can expand to fit the steel cases and then get stuck in the chamber. If you are shooting a lot of steel cases, it is best to clean your chamber and barrel after each use to prevent any stuck cases.

Hey everyone! 

I recently discovered an amazing story-driven game on Amazon and I highly recommend it. The game is called [name of game] and it's an awesome experience that you don't want to miss. 

What's even better is that you can buy it from Amazon and activate it on Steam, which will give you the chance to get a holiday coupon. So if you're looking for a great game to play this holiday season, this is a great option. 

Plus, the game is currently on sale, so you can get it at a great price. So don't miss out and grab it today! 

Happy gaming!

It's easy to get caught up in the idea that more regulation is always better, but it's important to remember that there can be unintended consequences of regulation. We've seen this in the past with things like the War on Drugs, where the regulations have led to a host of unintended consequences, such as the growth of the prison industrial complex and the erosion of civil liberties. This makes me wary of forcing the issue when it comes to regulation, as we may not be aware of the long-term implications of our decisions.

It seems like lately, more and more companies are instituting policies to prevent customers from using their products in ways that could potentially harm themselves or others. This is especially true in the vaping industry, where companies are required to take extra steps in order to protect their customers from potential health hazards. 

This is mainly due to the fact that the vaping industry is heavily regulated, and companies are being forced to take these policies in order to avoid massive fines. While it may seem like a burden to some, it's important to understand that these policies are put in place for the safety of everyone involved. Companies are forced to take these policies due to the potential for large sums of money going out the door if they don't comply.

"As a long-time vaper, I've noticed that one of the things that sets the best e-cigarette companies apart from the rest is their customer service. It's not just about the money they lose, but what they gain from providing over-the-top excellent customer service. 

They take the time to answer questions, help with troubleshooting, and provide helpful advice. They take the time to make sure their customers are satisfied and have the best possible experience with their products. 

It's not something that you can put a price tag on, but it's something that keeps customers coming back. Great customer service is worth its weight in gold, and it's one of the reasons why I stick with the same companies for all of my vaping needs."

It happens to everyone. Flamers, ragers and trolls come in every shape and size. But don't let them get you down. The best way to deal with them is to play with friends. That way, you can enjoy the game and have someone to talk to if things get rough. Remember, you're not alone!

Bringing Bibles and food to people in need is often seen as a way to help those in poverty, but it doesn't do as much good as we think it does. Not everyone is religious, and many people in need don't have access to the resources to cook or store the food. Instead, it's better to focus on providing access to education and job opportunities, as well as providing basic necessities like clothing, shelter, and healthcare. It's also important to remember that poverty is much more complicated than just a lack of resources, and requires a holistic approach that goes beyond simply providing material goods.

I just got back from a mission trip to Africa and it was an eye-opening experience. I was expecting to be able to help people, to make a difference, but instead I found myself doing nothing but sitting around and listening to people preach. I was so disappointed and frustrated that I lost my faith in the power of missions. 

I'm sure there are plenty of mission trips that do great work, but this one was not one of them. It felt like a waste of time and money. We didn't even get to interact with the people we were supposedly helping. It was just a bunch of people preaching and trying to convert people to their religion. 

I'm sorry if this is too much text. I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm still struggling to process what I experienced and I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to regain my faith in mission trips.

In the immortal words of /b/: "Do it, faggot."

It's a phrase that's been around for years, and it's become a mantra of sorts for many of us on the internet. Whether we use it as a way to motivate ourselves, or as a way to troll someone, it's become a part of our culture.

At first, it was just a way to encourage someone to do something. But it's taken on a whole new meaning in recent years, and has become a way to shame someone for not doing something.

It's a phrase that's been used in some rather unsavory ways, and it's something that we should be careful with. We should be careful to not use it as a way to bully or harass someone, but rather as a way to motivate and encourage.

So, in the immortal words of /b/: "Do it, faggot."

Hey everyone!

If you're looking to connect with other photographers in your area, a great way to do it is to join a Facebook group specifically for local photographers. You can search for the group on Facebook, or use the search bar at the top of the page to find groups related to photography in your area.

Once you join the group, you can start connecting with other photographers in your area, share tips and advice, and even collaborate on projects. It's a great way to network and learn more about photography.

Good luck!

I recently heard a sermon about Plato's cave and the analogy of being in darkness but the light is coming. I was struck by how fitting it was to the Christian walk. We are in the darkness, but we have faith that the light is coming and that we will be with God. Beyond that, there's not much we can do but shrug. We can trust that God will take care of us and that He has a plan for us. He is the ultimate source of light and hope.

I recently looked into the Robin Hood Foundation, and I didn't find anything out of the ordinary. I read through their financial statements, looked at their investments, and read through their mission statement. Everything seemed to be in line with what a charitable foundation should be doing.

I was a bit surprised, as I had heard some rumors about the organization that were a bit concerning. But after doing my own research, I'm happy to say that everything seems to be above board.

IF this is a conspiracy and it was some sort of inside job, WHY?

This is a question that has been asked many times in the conspiracy community and the answer is not always clear. It is possible that the motive behind the conspiracy could be anything from a political agenda to a financial gain. It could also be a combination of factors.

There could be evidence that suggests a particular motive, but it is often difficult to prove and is often circumstantial. It is also possible that the motive could be something completely different than what is being speculated.

The only way to truly know the motive behind a conspiracy is to look at the evidence and draw your own conclusions. Unfortunately, this is often difficult to do without access to the people and organizations behind the conspiracy.

This post is about the evolution of programming languages.

Programming languages have come a long way since their inception. What started as literal instructions of what to do with the machine have evolved into shorthand languages that are easier to use and understand. These languages can be used to create even shorter and simpler control languages, allowing us to easily control machines.

The evolution of programming languages is an interesting one, and it is amazing to see how far we have come in such a short amount of time. It is amazing to think that what started as literal instructions of what to do with the machine has now become a shorthand language that can be used to control machines easily.

The Belgian Royal Family is one of the wealthiest in Europe. The King, Queen and their four children are estimated to be worth around €3.8 billion. 

Despite this, the Belgian government provides the royal family with an annual budget of around €50 million. This money is used to pay for the upkeep of palaces, salaries for staff, and other expenses.

I believe that the Belgian Royal Family should not receive any tax money. They are wealthy enough to support themselves, and the money could be put to better use elsewhere. 

Belgium has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with the government having to take drastic measures to protect the economy. It would be better to use the money that is currently being spent on the Royal Family to help those in need. 

What do you think? Should the Belgian Royal Family receive tax money or not?

Well, I'm sure there's plenty of people out there who feel the same way. The Pittsburgh Steelers have had a rough few years and it's been frustrating to watch. It's clear that they need to make some changes to get back to their winning ways. The NFL draft is a great opportunity to do that, but unfortunately it doesn't seem like they're taking full advantage of it. They've missed out on some great prospects and it's been extremely disappointing. So yeah, Fuck Pitt.

Getting out of diamond has, so far, been impossible. I've been stuck in this rank for months, and it seems like no matter what I do, I can't break out of it. I've tried different builds, different strategies, and even different races, but nothing seems to work. I'm starting to think that maybe I'm just not good enough to get out of diamond. Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice would be much appreciated.

Welcome to my post about paragraphs with a space separating them!

A paragraph is a group of related sentences that discuss a single topic. When writing a paragraph, it is important to leave a space between each paragraph. This helps to make your writing easier to read and understand.

When writing a longer document, such as an essay or report, it is also important to leave a space between each paragraph. This helps to break up the text and make it easier to read.

It is also important to remember that each paragraph should have its own topic. This helps to keep your writing focused and organized.

Finally, it is important to remember to proofread your writing. This will help to ensure that your paragraphs are properly spaced and that your writing is free from errors.

I hope this post has helped to explain the importance of leaving a space between paragraphs. Thanks for reading!

Have you ever heard of the saying "One man's trash is another man's treasure"? Well, that saying holds true for this story. 

Recently, a waste facility employee was sorting through a pile of trash when he felt a sharp pain in his hand. He had been stabbed by a needle! After a bit of investigation, it was discovered that the needle had been thrown in the trash by a customer. 

It's a good reminder to be careful with what you throw away. Even the tiniest of items can cause a lot of trouble if they end up in the wrong place. So, make sure to properly dispose of any hazardous materials and double check that nothing sharp is in the trash.

Taking more pics increases your odds for a good photo! This is a concept that I've found to be true time and time again. When I'm out shooting, I usually take a lot of shots of the same subject. I take a few from different angles, different exposures, and different compositions. Then, when I'm back at home, I can look through all the photos and pick out the best one. Taking more shots also allows you to experiment and try out different ideas. You never know what you might come up with. So, next time you're out shooting, don't be afraid to take a lot of photos. The more you take, the better your chances of getting a great shot!

It's no secret that gun control has become a hot topic in the US, and it's becoming increasingly clear that it's being used as a pawn in a larger political game. It's sad to see that the lives of innocent people are being put at risk in order to score political points. Gun control should not be a pawn in a chess game. It should be taken seriously and addressed in a meaningful way that actually helps to reduce gun violence.

It's amazing how difficult it can be to follow two simple commands: "Love God, love your neighbor." We live in a world where people are so focused on themselves and their own interests that they forget to love their neighbor and to love God. We are so wrapped up in our own lives that we forget to take time to care for others, to show compassion and to put God first. It's easy to get caught up in our own lives and to forget the importance of loving God and loving our neighbor. We should strive to remember these two simple commands and to live our lives in accordance with them. It's not always easy, but it's worth it.

I recently ran a fantasy world circus campaign for my group and it was a lot of fun! The trick was to crank it up to 15 and make it truly memorable. We had all sorts of crazy acts and creatures, from a fire-breathing dragon to a troupe of acrobatic goblins. The players had to figure out how to keep the circus running and deal with the various challenges that arose. It was a great way to mix up the usual dungeon crawling and it really made the campaign stand out. So if you're looking for a unique and memorable experience, crank your fantasy world circus up to 15!

I recently got a tattoo and I wanted to share my experience. I was a bit apprehensive at first because I had no idea what to expect, but I decided to go ahead and talk to the tattoo artist. They were really friendly and helpful, and they explained the whole process to me in detail.

It was really reassuring to have someone who knew what they were doing, and it made me feel a lot more comfortable with the whole experience. So if you're thinking about getting a tattoo, don't be afraid to talk to your tattoo artist - it's what they do!

It's no secret that autistic people often excel in artistic and academic pursuits. Many of us have found success in these areas, and it's no surprise that med and high functioning autistic people do best when they are surrounded by like-minded individuals.

The key to success for autistic people is to find an environment that is conducive to their needs and interests. Artistic and academic communities provide a safe and supportive environment where autistic people can explore their interests and develop their skills.

These communities also provide a platform for autistic people to connect with others who share similar interests. This can be incredibly beneficial for autistic people, as it allows them to build relationships and learn to work with others.

At the same time, these communities also provide an opportunity for autistic people to learn from their peers. This can be a great way to gain insight into different perspectives and approaches to problem solving.

Overall, med and high functioning autistic people do best in artistic and academic communities. These communities can provide a safe and supportive environment for autistic people to grow and thrive.

So, to recap, opinions don't matter, facts do. 

It's easy to get caught up in the debates and discussions that happen on sports forums like this one. But at the end of the day, it's important to remember that opinions don't matter, facts do. 

It's easy to get caught up in the subjective opinions of others, but it's important to remember that the only thing that matters is the facts. Whether you agree with them or not, the facts are the only things that should be taken into consideration when forming an opinion or making a decision. 

So, let's make sure to keep the facts in mind and not get too caught up in the subjective opinions of others.

As a web developer, I often come across clients that don't address SEO in the requirements for their website. While SEO is important for a website, it has little to do with the development process if it hasn't been specifically addressed in the requirements. 

It's important to make sure that the website is coded in a way that is optimized for SEO, but it's not something that needs to be taken into consideration during the initial development process. The focus should be on creating a website that meets the requirements and looks the way the client wants it to. Once the website is built, then it can be optimized for SEO. 

If SEO is not addressed in the requirements, then it's best to leave it out of the development process and focus on creating a website that meets the client's needs. SEO can always be addressed later, once the website is built.

Today I learned a valuable lesson. I was at a party last night and I was feeling really down about myself. I was having a hard time talking to people and I felt like everyone was judging me. I was about to leave when my friend came up to me and said "You're fine". I was taken aback by his words and he just smiled and said it again.

It's not uncommon for relationships to face issues in the bedroom. If your girl won't put out, then it's important to find someone to talk to about it. Having a friend or family member who you can vent to can help you sort through your feelings and figure out how to best handle the situation. It's important to remember that it's not your fault, and that your partner's lack of interest in sex doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide whether you want to stay in the relationship and try to work through the issue, or move on and find someone who's more interested in physical intimacy.

I recently heard someone say that TV is like showering a crowd with a fire hose, while the internet is like giving everyone a water bottle. 

It got me thinking about how different media can be used to reach different audiences. With TV, you can reach a lot of people at once, but the message is often watered down and is not tailored to the individual viewer. On the other hand, the internet allows you to target specific audiences with tailored content, but it's much harder to reach a large number of people. 

What do you think? Is this analogy accurate? How do you think TV and the internet compare when it comes to reaching audiences?

Hey everyone! 

I'm sure many of us are trying to stay healthy while in school, and I've got a few tips that can help. At the very minimum, I can almost guarantee you will be healthier and lose fat if you: 

1. Eat better, eat less, drink more water and less sugary sodas. 
2. Exercise regularly, even if just a 30 min bike ride 4 times a week for the whole term. 

Everything beyond these minimums will improve results and let you 'customize' a bit. But don't go crazy. Eating nothing will likely kill you. Exercising 5 hours a day 9 days a week will likely affect your grades and space-time itself. 

So, take it easy and take care of yourself! Good luck everyone!

Everyone's opinion is not equal.

In a society that values free speech and open dialogue, it can be difficult to accept that not everyone's opinion is equal. We are all entitled to our own opinions, but that doesn't mean that every opinion is correct or valid. Some opinions are based on facts, while others are based on personal beliefs or biases.

It is important to remember that opinions can be judged on the basis of accuracy, logic, and evidence, and that not all opinions are created equal. It is important to think critically about the opinions we encounter, and to recognize that some opinions are more valid than others.

When it comes to shopping for firewalls, there are three important factors to consider: functionality, cost, and ease of configuration. 

Functionality is key when it comes to choosing the right firewall for your needs. Make sure the firewall you choose can handle the traffic you need it to and has the features you need to ensure your network is secure. 

Cost is also an important factor. While it can be tempting to go with the cheapest option, it's important to make sure the firewall you choose is within your budget and offers the features you need. 

Finally, ease of configuration is important. Make sure the firewall you choose is easy to configure and manage. A firewall that is difficult to configure can cost you time and money in the long run. 

By taking the time to consider these three factors, you can make sure you choose the right firewall for your needs.

It looks like Mike Conley's slump is full-blown. He's been a starting point guard for a while now, but his recent performance has been far from stellar. He's shooting just 39.3% from the field and 28.5% from three-point range. He's averaging just 8.8 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 5.2 assists per game. His turnovers have also been up, at 3.9 per game. 

Conley has always been a solid point guard, but he's been far from a specialist. He's had to do a lot of the heavy lifting for the Memphis Grizzlies, and he's done it well. But now, it looks like he's in a full-blown slump. It's time for the Grizzlies to find a way to get him back on track.

It's amazing how people can be so judgmental about something as subjective as attraction. You don't choose who you're attracted to, and it's not something you can control. It's not something you can change, so why judge someone for something they have no control over? Seriously, it's not like people are going around choosing who they're attracted to like they're picking out a shirt or something. 

It's really disheartening to see people so quick to judge others for something they can't help. We all have our own preferences, and that's okay. We should be more accepting of people and their attractions, regardless of what they are.

I'm not a fan of ants in general, but queen ants are just the worst. I was walking through my backyard the other day and I saw this giant ant hill with a bunch of ants coming in and out.

It's often said that Japanese people don't play PC games because of the prevalence of handhelds, consoles, and porn. While it's true that the gaming industry in Japan is heavily focused on handhelds and consoles, it's not true that PC gaming is completely absent. In fact, PC gaming has a long history in Japan, and there are still many PC games that are popular today.

The reason why PC gaming isn't as popular in Japan as it is in the West is mainly due to the fact that most Japanese households don't have a PC. This is due to the high cost of PCs and the fact that most people prefer to use their phones and tablets for gaming. Additionally, the lack of a good broadband infrastructure in Japan means that online gaming is not as popular as it is in the West.

However, there are still many Japanese gamers who play PC games. One of the most popular genres is MMORPGs, with games like Final Fantasy XIV and Dragon Quest X being some of the most popular. Additionally, there are many other genres of PC games that are popular in Japan, such as visual novels, rhythm games, and shooters.

So while it's true that handhelds, consoles, and porn are popular in Japan, it's not true that PC gaming is completely absent. There are still many PC gamers in Japan, and there are plenty of great PC games for them to enjoy.

It seems that boxing, soccer, Formula 1, and handball are all struggling in the US television market. With the rise of streaming services, it's becoming increasingly difficult for these sports to find a place in the US television market. With the lack of exposure, it's no wonder why these sports are starting to struggle in the US. It's a shame to see that these sports, which have been around for so long, are struggling in the US market. Hopefully, with the help of streaming services, these sports can find a way to get more exposure in the US.

Hey everyone, 

I've been a boxing fan for a long time, and I know that it can be a difficult sport to understand. I've been in the same position as many of you, trying to make sense of the sport and the rules and the strategies. 

I get you. I understand the confusion and the frustration. I understand why it can be hard to get into the sport, and why it can be hard to stay interested. 

But I'm here to tell you that boxing is a great sport, and it's worth the effort to learn and understand it. With the right knowledge and understanding, you can really appreciate the beauty of the sport. 

So don't give up! There are plenty of resources out there to help you learn and understand the sport, and I'm sure you'll find yourself falling in love with boxing in no time. 

Thanks for reading, and good luck!

We got issues.

As nurses, we have a lot of issues to deal with. From staffing shortages, to long shifts, to inadequate compensation, it seems like there's no end to the challenges we face. And on top of that, we have to deal with the daily stress of caring for patients and their families.

It's easy to get overwhelmed and discouraged by all of this, but it's important to remember that we're not alone. There are lots of other nurses out there who are dealing with the same issues, and together we can make a difference. We can advocate for better working conditions, better pay, and better patient care.

So let's take a stand and fight for what we deserve. We got issues, and it's time to do something about it.

League of Legends is a global game, and it's no surprise that the Asian regions have been dominating for years. Even though other regions have been catching up, the Asian teams still remain the top dogs.

It's always a pleasure to watch the Asian teams play, with their high level of coordination and mechanics. They really make the game look easy and it's clear they take the game very seriously.

On the other hand, other regions have been struggling to keep up. It's almost like they don't take the game seriously enough and they often get stomped by the Asian teams. It's no wonder why the Asian teams remain at the top of the competitive scene.

If other regions want to compete with the Asian teams, they need to take the game more seriously and put in the hard work. Otherwise, they'll keep getting stomped like amateurs.

Don't let him know that at one point you fell asleep, even if it was really cool. 

I recently had a date with a guy I was really interested in. We talked for hours and it was going great, until I suddenly realized I had completely dozed off! I was so embarrassed, but I managed to play it off like I was just really relaxed. I'm sure he noticed, but I'm hoping he didn't realize I actually fell asleep. Has anyone else had a similar experience? What did you do?

Good sex is more than just physical pleasure - it's also about communication. If you're not communicating with your partner, you're missing out on a lot of potential pleasure. Communication is key when it comes to sex, and it can help you both be more satisfied and explore new boundaries. So don't be afraid to talk to your partner about what you like and what you don't. It's the only way to make sure both of you are getting the most out of your sex life.

I recently had to have a tooth extracted and it was not a pleasant experience. I'm not sure why it was necessary, but it was an important procedure that had to be done.

This got me thinking about how often people neglect their teeth and how important it is to take care of them. We often forget that our teeth are one of the most important parts of our body and should not always be out of the question when it comes to our health.

It is so important to brush and floss regularly, and to make sure we are getting regular dental checkups. Not only will this help to keep our teeth healthy, but it can also help to prevent other health issues that can arise from poor dental hygiene.

So, next time you are considering skipping your dental checkup or brushing your teeth, remember that your teeth should not always be out of the question!

"Hey Reddit!

I'm having a bit of a dilemma and I'm hoping you can help. I have been having these dreams lately where I wake up and there's a girl standing there looking at me with a gentle smile on her face. She's always different in each dream, but I can't help but feel like I know her.

It's almost like she's the girl of my dreams and I'm wondering if there's any way I can make this into reality. Is there any way I can make this dream come true?

If you're feeling a bit uncertain of yourself sexually, don't worry - you're not alone! It's totally normal to feel a bit confused or overwhelmed by all the different types of sexual identities and orientations out there.

My advice for anyone feeling a bit unsure about their sexuality is to take your time and explore what feels right for you. Don't be afraid to talk to people who have more experience and knowledge than you, and don't be afraid to experiment and explore!

At the end of the day, the most important thing is to be true to yourself and to be comfortable in your own skin.

Good luck!"

Hi everyone,

I'm sure we can all agree that hormones can be a real pain sometimes. From mood swings to acne to cravings, hormones can really mess with us. So I wanted to hear your stories about how hormones have been whack for you! What crazy things have you experienced because of hormones?

I agree with you that life can be unpredictable and full of surprises. It's important to remain open to new experiences and opportunities, even if they seem daunting at first. Life can take us in unexpected directions, and it's important to be prepared for whatever comes our way.

Hey everyone, 

I recently stopped wearing anti-perspirant and I've noticed a huge difference in my sweat levels. I've almost stopped sweating altogether, which has been great! 

However, I now have a problem. I've bought a few new shirts recently, and they seem to be attracting sweat a lot more than my older shirts. Does anyone have any advice on how I can make sure my new shirts don't get stained? 

Thanks in advance!

Hey everyone,

I recently discovered a great way to make my clothes look great - baking soda and peroxide! I had some old t-shirts that were looking a bit dingy and decided to give this a try. I mixed a tablespoon of baking soda and a tablespoon of peroxide together and then soaked my shirts in the mixture for about 30 minutes. After that, I washed them as normal and was amazed at the results! The shirts were brighter and looked much newer.

I'm sure this isn't a new trick, but I thought I'd share it in case it helps anyone else out. Baking soda and peroxide = awesomeness!

After a 6 year break, I'm back to collecting Warhammer 40K miniatures! I currently have around 4000-5000 points of Tau (not including 1500 points of Kroot Kindred), 3000 of Salamanders, 1000 of Pre-Heresy, 1000 of post-heresy 1k Sons, 2000 Ulthwe Eldar, 500(?) Orks, 2000 Lizardmen, 500 Brettonians, Van Saar and Cawdor gangs, and a Lizardmen Blood Bowl team. It's been a lot of fun getting back into the hobby and I'm looking forward to adding to my collection!

"My SO and I are having a disagreement about how to define his sexuality. He identifies as 'straight' but he has had sexual experiences with men in the past. I understand that labels are not important and that he can identify however he wants, but I think it's important to have an accurate understanding of his identity so that we can talk about it. 

I started my post framing that we were going to call him bisexual or gay (HENCE THE "BY DEFINITION", meaning, if you want to know what I mean, consult a fucking dictionary, kind of like what I just fucking did in this post) so that I would have a selection of different words with different connotations in the context so we can properly discuss the situation. 

Unfortunately, my SO got offended and accused me of being 'hyper-PC neo-sexist nazi'. I don't think I was being offensive, but I understand that the words I used may have been hurtful. I don't want to invalidate my SO's feelings, but I also don't want to be accused of something I'm not. 

How can I approach this conversation without offending my SO? I want to make sure that we can have an open discussion about his identity without any hurt feelings."

I had heard some strange stories about Bruce, but this one takes the cake. Apparently, when he was a kid, he got caught sniffing another man's ass. After that, he trained hard to make sure he never got caught again. I'm not sure what kind of training he did, but I'm guessing it involved a lot of running and hiding. Whatever it was, it must have worked, because I've never heard of him getting caught again.

Recently I was looking for a gun that would pass the drop test, and I was told that a gun that can pass the drop test can be safely dropped on a rubber surface, but can still go off when dropped on a hard surface. This was a surprise to me, as I had always assumed that if a gun was designed to pass the drop test, it would be safe to drop on any surface.

It turns out that this isn't the case, and it's important to remember that even if a gun is designed to pass the drop test, it can still go off if dropped on a hard surface. So if you're looking for a gun that can pass the drop test, make sure you know what type of surface it can be dropped on safely.

We live in an age of information, and it is becoming increasingly important to be able to back up our assertions with arguments and evidence. This isn't just applicable to theists, but to everyone. We should all strive to be able to support our claims with reliable sources and logical arguments.

The idea that atheism is given some special handicap in debate is a myth. Everyone must be able to back up their claims with arguments and evidence, regardless of their beliefs. The truth of an assertion is not dependent on one's religious or philosophical views, but on the quality of the argument and evidence that is presented.

Therefore, it is important to remember that everyone must back up their assertions with arguments and evidence. There is no cosmic debate coach who is giving a special handicap to atheism. We all need to be able to make our case and support it with reliable sources and logical arguments.
|


I'm often asked about my beliefs in regards to religion, and I've always struggled with how to accurately describe them. I've come to the conclusion that the best way to accurately describe my beliefs is to use the term "agnostic". 

I don't claim to know the answers to the big questions in life, such as whether or not there is a higher power, or what happens after death. I'm not sure if anyone can truly know the answers to these questions, and so I'm content to remain agnostic. 

I'm open to the possibility that there is a higher power, and I'm certainly willing to explore different spiritual paths. However, I'm not sure if any of these paths will lead me to a definitive answer to the big questions. So, I'm content to remain agnostic, and accept that I may never know the answers.
|


It's amazing how many people still don't realize that atheism is not a belief system, but rather the lack of belief in any gods or deities. It's not about having a problem with religion or any particular faith, it's about not believing in something that has no evidence to support it. So yes, there is a problem when people don't understand that atheism is simply the absence of belief in gods.

This is a great way to manipulate the average last trades price on Diablo 3. I've been doing this for quite a while and it works like a charm. You list 1 commodity for 100g and instantly buy it from yourself. Do this as fast as possible until the average price goes down as much as half or more. Then you place small orders to gobble up the cheapies people just listed or anyone who panicked and lowered their price. The risk is even less than what you thought, and you can make a nice profit with this method.

Hey everyone! 

I know that living in a new place can be difficult and overwhelming, especially if it's not your choice to be there. But I just wanted to share some words of encouragement - put a smile on your face, accept that this is where you live for right now, and treat it like anywhere else that's new to you: like a good sport. 

It's hard, but you don't have to suffer alone. Reach out to your friends, family, and even strangers in the area and make the most of it. Who knows, you might even find a hidden gem or two. 

Take care and stay safe!

I recently responded to a missed connection post on Reddit. A few weeks later, I'm at work and there's a new employee subbing in. After talking to him for a bit, I realized he was the same person I had responded to. We went out for dinner and it was kind of like a date. After spending more time with him, I realized he was a boring loser. I'm not sure what to do next. Should I just keep it professional and ignore the fact that we had a connection, or should I confront him about it?

Hey Summoners!

As someone who has been playing League of Legends for a while, I've noticed that a lot of players tend to stick to playing ADC as their main role. While ADC is definitely a fun role to play, it's also one of the most difficult roles to carry from.

My advice to all of you is to take some time to learn all the other roles in the game. Not only will this help you become a better player, but it will also give you a better understanding of the game overall. Learning all the roles will also give you more options in team compositions and will make you a more valuable asset to your team.

So, if you're an ADC main, take some time to learn all the other roles in the game. You won't regret it!

Thanks,

SummonerSchool

"We all know that commentors on Reddit can get pretty butthurt when the rules change, but that doesn't mean we should change them just to appease them. We should always strive to make the rules fair for everyone, and not just for those who are loudest about their displeasure. So, the next time you see a commentor getting upset about a rule change, just remember: Butthurt commentors aren't a reason to change the rules."

We all know that the government's budget is limited and that resources should be used wisely. But too often, the government spends money on projects that don't have any real benefit or that only benefit a few people.

We should be focusing on projects that have real, tangible benefits for the most people. Let's build infrastructure that can help reduce traffic and pollution, or invest in renewable energy sources that can help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Let's invest in education and healthcare so that everyone can have access to quality services.

At the same time, let's not spend money on projects that only benefit a few people or that don't have any real benefit. And let's definitely not spend money on projects that only benefit those who are already wealthy and powerful.

We must make sure that the government is spending the taxpayers' money in a responsible and effective way. Let's build the stuff that has good benefits, and equally, don't spend revenue on stupid stuff. And, most importantly, let's not put a bunch of money in the pockets of assholes.

|


It's amazing how many people think they're experts on something when in reality they know nothing about it. I'm tired of hearing their endless chatter about topics they know nothing about. So, let me just say this: you're still talking out of your ass! A single fart out of my ass contains more wisdom than an hour of your ramblings.

Hey everyone,

I'm a former martial arts instructor and I've seen a lot of people try to learn martial arts without proper instruction. It's not a good idea. I've seen people get hurt or even worse, hurt themselves because they didn't know the proper technique.

That's why I'm so impressed by this guy. He's doing it the right way. He's taking the time to learn the proper techniques and he's doing it so he doesn't hurt himself.

It's not easy, but it's worth it. If you're thinking about learning a martial art, make sure you find a qualified instructor who can teach you the right way.

Thanks for reading!

This post is about Royce Gracie's dominance in the early days of the UFC. 

Royce Gracie's dominance in the early UFC events was due to the particular moment in history, not the inherent superiority of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ). Royce Gracie was the first to use BJJ in the UFC, and his style was a perfect fit for the rules of the time. He was able to use his grappling to outmaneuver his opponents and win by submission. 

However, as the sport of MMA evolved, the rules of the UFC changed and the fighters began to use a more well-rounded approach. This allowed for fighters of different styles to be successful in the UFC. As a result, Royce Gracie's dominance faded away as others began to use a variety of techniques to win. 

It is important to note that while Royce Gracie was the pioneer of BJJ in the UFC, his success was due to the particular moment in history, not the inherent superiority of BJJ. The UFC has since evolved to the point where fighters of different styles can be successful, and BJJ is no longer the dominant style it once was.

I've been playing League of Legends for a few weeks now, and I've been trying to figure out the best way to engage in team fights.

I recently had an issue with a product I purchased and voiced my complaint to the company. After getting some feedback from the company, I still stand by what I said, but I'm sorry that I voiced my complaint in a way that was unprofessional and didn't take into account the impact it could have on their business. I understand that they have a right to protect their reputation and I take full responsibility for my actions. I hope that we can move forward and have a better relationship in the future.

It's not uncommon for people to see a wild animal and think they can keep it as a pet, but please don't do that with a baby fox or wolf.

It's best to leave them in the wild where they belong.

It's no secret that revolutions are often doomed to fail. We've seen it time and time again throughout history, and it's clear that the only way to make lasting change is to show that we can be better than what we are. 

We can't just fight our way to a better world. We need to be proactive and work together to create a better society. We need to be open to dialogue and compromise, and we need to recognize that there are no easy solutions. 

It's easy to make jokes about revolutions, but the truth is that these changes can be dangerous and even deadly. We need to take them seriously, and we need to be willing to put in the hard work and dedication required to make them successful. 

So let's not make light of revolutions. Let's show that we can be better and make lasting change. We can do this if we work together and approach the situation with an open mind.

It's been a while since I've played DotA2, but I remember that Keeper of the Light (Kotl) is a hero that relies heavily on his allies for mana. He can't keep their mana up until level 3 at the earliest, and since he lacks a stun, he will get trashed by 95% of trilanes. It's a waste of 3 heroes to go against a solo when 2 of them would fair just as well.

My girlfriend and I have been together for a few months now, and I'm starting to feel like she's getting a bit too dependent on me. She always wants to text me and talk to me all the time, and I'm starting to feel like I'm losing my independence. I know that communication is important in a relationship, but I don't want to be constantly available to her. I told her that I think it's ok to text, but that it's up to her to decide how often she wants to do it. I want her to be able to have her own life, and not feel like she has to be connected to me all the time. How can I help her understand that it's ok to give each other space?

Basically, when it comes to cutting corners in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, you can use your imagination. From reducing the amount of time spent on teaching and training to cutting back on the number of resources allocated to church activities, there are many ways the Church can save money while still providing a quality experience for its members. It's important to remember, however, that any cost-saving measures should be balanced with the incentives that the Church provides its members, such as spiritual growth, fellowship, and service opportunities.

Greetings fellow gamers! 

I'm sure many of you have heard of the classic fighting game, Mortal Kombat. But have you heard of its spiritual successor, Biblical Kombat?

Biblical Kombat is a 2D fighting game which pits characters from the Bible against each other in epic battles. The game features characters such as Adam, Eve, Noah, Abraham, and Moses, as well as some of the more mythical biblical characters like the Leviathan, Behemoth, and the Angel of Death. 

The gameplay is fast-paced and the graphics are surprisingly good for a 2D game. The characters are all well-animated and the backgrounds are detailed and colorful. The game also features a variety of special moves and combos that you can use to defeat your opponents. 

If you're looking for a fun and unique fighting game, I highly recommend checking out Biblical Kombat. It's a great way to experience the Bible in a new and exciting way.

It's a common misconception that wealthy people "don't pay taxes" or that they use loopholes to avoid paying taxes. This is simply not true. In the United States, the top 1% of earners pay nearly 40% of all federal income taxes. The top 10% pay 70% of all federal income taxes. While it's true that wealthy individuals and corporations can take advantage of certain tax breaks and deductions, this does not mean they are not paying taxes. Tax avoidance is illegal and those who are caught doing it face serious consequences. In short, the myth that wealthy people don't pay taxes is just that - a myth.

I'm a big fan of the Mario games, and I've been playing them since I was a kid. I love the new 3DS games, but I can't help but feel like they're too easy.

"What did ants finally do that was good?

I recently read about a study that showed that ants can help reduce the spread of malaria. Ants are known to feed on the larvae of mosquitoes, which are the main carriers of malaria. By eating the larvae, ants help to reduce the number of adult mosquitoes that can spread the disease.

This is great news, as malaria is one of the leading causes of death in many parts of the world. It's amazing to think that something as small as an ant can have such a huge impact on the health of people. So, it's safe to say that ants have finally done something good!"

I was at the local convenience store today and I saw something pretty wild. There was this South African lady who was having a hot flush and she was getting really angry.

Eventually she got her scratchie and stormed out of the store.

Hello everyone,

I recently had the opportunity to do some work in Cyprus and I was treated like an exhibit in a museum while I was there. People would come up to me and ask me questions about where I was from and what I was doing there.

Has anyone else had a similar experience? How did you handle it?

I worked at a cafe in Australia for a few months, and we had a lot of South African patrons. Some of them were really nice, but others were just horrible. 

One time, a soccer mum nearly slapped me when I told her that we were out of her order. She got really angry and started screaming and shouting at me. I was so scared that I just backed away and she eventually left. 

Another time, I had a plate thrown at me by another woman when I told her that we were out of her order. She was so angry that she just picked up her plate and threw it at me. Luckily, it didn't hit me, but it was still a pretty scary experience. 

I'm glad that I'm no longer working at that cafe, but it's definitely something that I'll never forget.

I just wanted to remind everyone that although Ingress is a competitive game, it's still just a game. We all should be respectful of one another regardless of which team we're on.

We should all be able to enjoy the game without having to resort to name-calling and other forms of negative behavior.

Thanks for reading!"

"I'm sure many of us have noticed that the version numbers for the game often don't make a whole lot of sense. For example, the current version is 13.675.6, but the last major update was 13.675.5. What's the difference between these two versions?

The answer is that the game is actually developed in partnership with a number of different companies. Each company has their own version number and the final version number is a combination of all of them. So, the difference between the two versions could be a minor bug fix or a new feature from one of the partner companies.

It's a bit confusing, but it is what it is. Hopefully, the version numbers will make more sense in the future!"

No roaming pressure makes lane phase boring oh so boring.

I've been playing Smite for a few months now and I'm starting to get bored of the lane phase. I feel like there's no roaming pressure or anything to make it interesting. I'm just stuck in lane, farming and trying to push my lead. I miss the old days when there was actual roaming pressure and players were trying to outplay each other in lane.

What do you guys think? Do you think there's a way to make the lane phase more interesting?

I've been using Nagios for a few years now and I can honestly say that the 3.2.3 version is the most stable version out there. I've tried other versions, but they all seem to be plagued with bugs and other issues. With 3.2.3, I haven't had any issues so far. It's also the version that most of the other sysadmins I know are using. So if you're looking for a reliable version of Nagios, 3.2.3 is definitely the one to go with.

It's easy to get caught up in the physical appearance of our bodies and forget about the amazing things our bodies can do. We tend to focus on how we look and how we compare to others, but it's important to remember that our bodies are capable of so much more.

Our bodies are designed to move and do incredible things. We can run, jump, lift, and do so much more. Instead of focusing on what our bodies look like, let's focus on what they can do. Let's appreciate our strength, our endurance, and our ability to push ourselves.

Our bodies are capable of so much more than just looking good. Let's celebrate our bodies for all the amazing things they can do.

Not monetary, regulatory. There's a difference.

We often hear about the need for more regulation in the financial sector, but it's important to recognize that there is a difference between monetary and regulatory policy. Monetary policy is the policy of a central bank or other financial authority that sets the parameters for the money supply and interest rates, while regulatory policy is the set of laws and regulations that govern how financial institutions and markets operate.

The two are closely related, and both have a major impact on the economy. But it's important to understand the distinction between them and how they interact. Monetary policy is focused on controlling the money supply and interest rates, while regulatory policy focuses on protecting consumers and ensuring that financial institutions and markets operate in a fair and efficient manner.

In recent years, the focus has been on increasing regulation in the financial sector, but it's important to remember that monetary and regulatory policy are two sides of the same coin. Both are necessary to ensure a healthy and prosperous economy, and it's important to understand the differences between them.

It's a sad reality, but prescription cocaine is a thing, and some people are using it to get high. Unfortunately, this can be dangerous and even deadly. 

If you know someone who is using someone else's prescription cocaine, please do your best to talk to them about the risks and help them find a safe and healthy way to get help. Don't take someone else's prescription cocaine - it's not worth the risk.

It's inevitable that bad things will happen in life. No matter how hard we try to prevent them, they will still occur. When they do, it can be devastating. It can feel like your world is caving in and that you have temporarily lost your humanity. It can be hard to cope with and it can be difficult to find the strength to move forward. But it's important to remember that it's not the end of the world. You can and will get through this. It may take time, but you will be able to find your way back to being the best version of yourself.

If you don't edit all the numbers except for the amount and sweet note, you are going to have a fired time.

It's easy to get overwhelmed by all the numbers and details when dealing with finances. But if you can focus on the big picture and just edit the amount and a sweet note, you're going to have a great time.

No matter how much money you have, it's important to keep track of it and make sure you're spending it wisely. But don't let the numbers and details bog you down. Just focus on the amount and a sweet note, and you'll be able to make sure you're making the most of your money.

It's easy to get caught up in the idea that luck is the deciding factor in our lives. We may hear stories of people who have seemingly made it big overnight, and it can be tempting to think that luck is all it takes to get ahead. But the reality is that while luck can be a factor, it's usually hard work that makes it work for us. We have to put in the effort to make our dreams a reality, and luck can only take us so far. It's up to us to put in the work, and then luck can be the icing on the cake.

As an atheist, I have a strong opinion on tipping. It is an act of generosity, not an obligation. We should not be expected to tip out of guilt or fear of being judged. Tipping should be a voluntary act of kindness and appreciation for good service. It is up to the individual to decide how much to tip, or if to tip at all. It is not a requirement or an expectation. We should not be guilted into tipping and no one should be made to feel bad for not tipping.

As an atheist, it's hard to ignore the fact that the way we allow businesses to treat their employees in many countries has serious implications for the rest of us. We allow businesses to pay wages that are too low for people to live on, to not provide benefits, to not provide a safe and healthy work environment, and to not provide job security. This has real consequences for all of us.

Low wages mean that people can't afford basic necessities like housing and food, leading to increased poverty and inequality. Lack of benefits means that people are more likely to go without healthcare, leading to higher medical costs for everyone. Unsafe and unhealthy work environments can lead to more workplace accidents and illnesses, which can drive up insurance costs and reduce productivity. And lack of job security means that people are less likely to invest in their own education and training, leading to a less skilled workforce overall.

It's time that we recognize the consequences of our current system and take steps to ensure that businesses treat their employees fairly. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and to be paid a living wage. It's the only way to ensure a healthy and prosperous society for all.

"Here come the downvotes.

It's no secret that this subreddit is full of people who are passionate about their atheism. But sometimes that passion can lead to a kind of tribalism, where people are quick to downvote any opinion that doesn't match their own.

It's important to remember that we can disagree without resorting to downvotes. Let's try to have civil, respectful discussions and leave the downvotes out of it."

I'm a former restaurant GM and I'm here to tell you that the To Go people do just as much work as the waiters do. They take orders, package food, and help clean up. You just don't see it because they're usually in the back. So please, tip your To Go people. 

Some of you may be asking why you should have to pay for something you don't even see. Well, it doesn't matter. People like you would complain if the servers were paid a decent wage and the food cost was higher. The dollars spent would be the same either way, you just get a choice in being an asshole this way. So please, tip your To Go people.

My answer to this question is that volunteering is a great way to give back to the community and help those in need. It can also provide a great opportunity to gain experience and develop new skills. Volunteering can also open up new opportunities, such as networking and making new friends. It can also help to build self-confidence and self-esteem. Overall, volunteering is a great way to make a difference in the world and help those in need.

Hey everyone!

I'm so excited to be on this journey of getting in shape and running 5k! I'm currently on week 3 and today I managed to run for 15 minutes straight! I'm so proud of myself and it's really encouraging to see how far I've come in such a short time.

I know it can be hard to stay motivated and keep going, but just remember that 15 minutes is a great accomplishment! Keep pushing yourself and you'll be running 5k in no time.

Good luck to everyone else on their journey and keep up the good work!

I'm a big believer in having a balanced life, so I try to keep most of the weekend to friends/family/errands. I'm not one to stay out late on the weekends or spend too much time in bars or restaurants. I like to go out and have fun, but I also like to have time to relax and spend time with those I care about. I think it's important to make sure you're taking care of yourself and those around you.

Hey everyone! 

I went on a first date with a guy last night and the first hour and fifteen minutes was awesome! We had great conversation and I felt like we really clicked. But then the last five minutes were a bit awkward, so now I'm just feeling a bit confused. 

Has anyone else ever been in a situation like this? What did you do?

EDIT: So, I decided to message the guy and he actually called me without even knowing about the message! We're going out again next week and I'm really excited. I guess sometimes it pays off to take the initiative. :)

I'm taking a class on the history of gender in the United States, and while I'm enjoying the class, I'm finding that we spend a lot of time discussing the role of women/gender in history rather than the actual history itself. It's like the class is more focused on the role of gender than the field itself. 

I'm wondering if this is a common experience for other women/gender classes, or if I'm just in a particularly gender-focused class. Do other women/gender classes focus more on the role of gender than the field itself?

So save your money and don't co-witness. It's just not worth it.

Jews went to America in the 1930s and 1940s in a desperate attempt to escape the Nazi concentration camps. However, they were not welcomed in the United States and were sent back to Europe, where many of them died in the concentration camps. This tragic story is an important reminder of the need to accept and welcome refugees and immigrants, regardless of their backgrounds. It is also a reminder of the terrible consequences of failing to do so.
|


This post is about the tragic history of Jews in America and the unimaginable suffering they faced during the Nazi regime.

In the 1930s, Jews in Europe faced increasing persecution by the Nazi regime and many sought refuge in the United States. However, they were not welcomed in America and were sent back to Europe, where they were sent to Nazi concentration camps. Thousands of Jews were murdered in these camps and millions more were subjected to inhumane conditions.

This is a reminder of the horrific events of the Holocaust and the importance of standing up for human rights. We must never forget the suffering of the Jews and the other victims of the Nazi regime. We must also never forget that America once turned its back on those seeking refuge from persecution and violence.

I think it's safe to say that there is a lot of evidence in support of evolution. There is a consensus among scientists that it's a valid theory, and it's been around for a long time. That said, it's important to remember that science is an ever-evolving field and new evidence can always come to light that challenges the current consensus. We have seen this in the past with theories being overturned or modified based on new evidence. So while I highly doubt that evolution will be completely overturned, it's important to remain open to new evidence that challenges the current consensus.

Working from a desk isn't easy, and this one will remind you of that. 

I'm sure many of us have had the experience of working from a desk that is too small, too big, or just plain uncomfortable. I recently had the misfortune of having to work at a desk that was way too small for me. It was an old, wooden desk, and it was so small that I had to sit on the edge of the seat just to fit my laptop on it. 

The desk was very uncomfortable to work on. I had to constantly adjust my position to make sure I had enough space to type and use the mouse. It was also so small that I had to keep my arms close together so that I wouldn't knock anything over. 

The desk was also incredibly difficult to keep clean. Every time I moved my laptop, crumbs and dust would fly everywhere. I felt like I was constantly cleaning the desk, and it was really starting to get on my nerves. 

Working from a desk is never easy, and this one reminded me of that. It was too small, too uncomfortable, and too difficult to keep clean. I'm so glad that I'm now able to work from a much more comfortable and spacious desk.

Being a lawyer is fucking boring 95% of the time. I'm sure there are some people who find it interesting, but in my experience, most of the work is tedious and uninspiring. From researching legal precedents to drafting motions and briefs, it's all just a bunch of paperwork and research. Even when I'm in court, it's usually a matter of making sure I have all my paperwork in order and presenting the facts in a compelling way. There's very little of the excitement that you see in movies or on TV.

I used to work in sales for a major corporation. It was a terrible experience. They will find any way to screw you over, even if they have to make up a reason. I was constantly threatened with disciplinary action for not meeting my sales goals, even though I was already doing the best I could. The company would also change the rules and policies on a whim and never tell us about it until after it was too late. It was a nightmare. I would never recommend anyone work in sales for a major corporation.

Hey Reddit,

I'm sure you probably all hate me. I've been a lurker for a while and I've seen some of the things people have said about me and it's not very nice. I'm sure you all have your reasons for disliking me, but I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. I'm sorry for whatever I've done to make you all hate me and I hope that one day you can forgive me.

Thanks,

Salesmanship is one of the most important skills one can learn in life. It's a skill that can be used in almost any job, from sales to customer service to management. Yet, it's often overlooked and undervalued.

At the same time, support staff are often taken for granted. They are the unsung heroes of any organization, providing essential services that keep the business running smoothly. They often work long hours with little recognition and often have to deal with difficult customers.

It's time to give support staff the credit they deserve. They are the backbone of any organization and without them, it would be impossible to run a successful business. So, let's recognize the hard work and dedication of our support staff and show them some appreciation.

"Deflation, in its harmful sense, means the destruction of money, and this is not what happens with gold and Bitcoin. Deflation is when the value of a currency decreases over time, meaning that the same amount of money can buy more goods and services. This can be a problem because it discourages people from spending, leading to a decrease in economic activity. Gold and Bitcoin, however, are not subject to deflation because their values are determined by supply and demand, not by central banks. Therefore, their values can go up or down, but they won't be destroyed by deflation."

I've been a metal fan for years and I can honestly say that In Flames' Revelations is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. The combination of melodic leads, powerful riffs and emotionally charged lyrics make it an absolute masterpiece. While Still Life is another great song by In Flames, I think Revelations takes the cake. There's something so unique and special about Revelations that can't be matched by any other metal song.

Haha, I love it! I just got lost in the world of Zelda Breath of the Wild and I can't seem to find my way out!

Hey everyone,

I just wanted to share my thoughts on playing Lich as a support. The key to playing him is to not hit your own creeps at all, let the carry hero handle that. Instead, you want to sacrifice them for mana non-stop with your 3rd skill. You can then use your 1st skill to harass the enemy heroes. In this way, you act like a babysitter for your laning partner.

For your item build, I recommend getting Tranquil Boots (Green Boots) to help with your sustain. You will have infinite mana and you can buy a Mekansm for the AoE heal. That's it!

Hope this helps and good luck in your games!

Flaming and blaming in DotA2 is a common problem. It can be very discouraging for newer players, and it can make the game less enjoyable for everyone. That's why it's important to remember that flamers have absolutely no reason to flame/blame and you have all the reasons in the world to ignore them. Unless they are your friends and they're trying to help you improve, in which case you should happily oblige.

No one likes being flamed or blamed, and it can be very disheartening. But if you don't let it get to you, you can still have a great time playing DotA2. So don't let the flamers ruin your day, and remember that you have all the reasons in the world to ignore them.

It's been a long time since I've been in the teaching profession, but I still love it. I'm passionate about helping students learn and grow and I'm constantly looking for new opportunities to do so. Unfortunately, sometimes it can be difficult to find a job that matches your enthusiasm. 

I've been in the same school for a few years now and I'm starting to feel like I'm in a bit of a rut. I'm still passionate about teaching, but I'm just not finding the same level of excitement that I used to.

It's been a while since I've played Heroes of Newerth, but I have to say that it's still just as fine as it is. The game has always been one of my favorite MOBA games and it still holds up to this day. The graphics are still great and the gameplay is still fun. I've been playing it for over five years now and it's still one of my go-to games when I have some free time. I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it yet.

I'm not paying $100+ to prove I'm good at a game when I can prove the same thing online and keep that extra $100 for groceries, clothes, etc. I'm a competitive player and I'm sure I can prove my skill in other ways than shelling out a ton of money. I'm sure there are other players like me who don't want to spend a fortune just to prove they can play a game.

It's amazing how some 14 year olds these days think they can get whatever they want. I recently had an experience with a spoiled 14 year old who thought he was entitled to everything and threw a temper tantrum when he didn't get it. I understand that children should be given certain luxuries, but this kid had no concept of the value of money or the importance of earning it himself. He had no concept of delayed gratification and was completely oblivious to the fact that his parents had to work hard to give him the things he had. This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable and it's no wonder why so many people think that spoiled 14 year olds are the worst people in the world.

"It's true, our generation is often painted as soft and mollycoddled, but it's not entirely our fault.

We should be focusing on building ourselves up and not letting the culture of ishit define us."

I hate Alzheimer's. It's such a horrible disease that robs people of their memories and their quality of life. I'm so thankful for the advances in science that are helping to fight this disease. From early detection to potential treatments and cures, scientists are working hard to give hope to those affected by Alzheimer's. I applaud their efforts and hope that one day soon, we will have a way to completely eradicate this disease.

A recent study published in the journal Nature Communications has found a link between high levels of sugar in the brain and the accumulation of a protein called amyloid-beta, which is associated with Alzheimer's disease. The study, conducted by researchers at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, found that when sugar levels increased in the brain, the protein amyloid-beta attached itself faster. This could potentially explain why people with diabetes are at greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The findings suggest that controlling sugar levels in the brain could be an important factor in preventing or slowing the progression of Alzheimer's.

It's been a while since we've seen any real innovation in the competitive League of Legends scene. Sure, there have been some small changes, but nothing that has really changed the game in any meaningful way. It's clear that it's going to take someone with a lot of skill and dedication to really make a difference in the game. Until then, we'll just have to wait and see what happens. It'll happen when someone skilled and dedicated enough comes along, and not before.

It seems like every day I hear politicians trying to redefine words to fit their agenda. Whether it's trying to call something that is clearly wrong "right" or trying to make an argument that doesn't make sense, it's just plain stupid. It's not going to make their agenda any truer, it's just going to make them look bad. People can see through this kind of manipulation and it's not going to help anyone in the long run. Let's get back to a place where facts and truth matter, not just what someone wants to call something.

"Hey everyone,

So I've been married for a few years now and for the past two Valentine's Days, I haven't been able to meet my wife's expectations. I've tried to make it special for her, but it didn't turn out the way she wanted. Now I'm afraid of another fight this year, so I'm thinking of asking her if we can just not celebrate Valentine's Day this year.

Do you think this is a good idea? Do you have any other suggestions for how I can avoid another fight this year?

Thanks!"

Know what stocks you want to buy, and when to buy them. Also, be aware of the risks involved and make sure you have a plan in place to manage them. Investing in the stock market can be a great way to grow your wealth, but it's important to understand the risks and have a plan in place.

I'm sure a lot of people can relate to this - I've got a lot of tattoos, most of them are meaningful to me in some way, but some of them are just for fun.

I love that I have this canvas to express myself and I'm always looking forward to getting more!

This is a difficult question to answer, as it depends on the content of the comment. Generally speaking, however, one could argue that a conclusion should be drawn from the comment, but it should not be the only takeaway. A conclusion should be based on the evidence presented, and should be supported by the arguments made in the comment. While the conclusion may be a valid one, it should not be the only thing taken away from the comment.

Trying to force people out of their bias only strengthens their resolve. We can't ignore the fact that many people are heavily invested in their own beliefs and opinions. We can't just expect them to change their minds overnight. The only way to really change someone's opinion is to provide them with facts and information that challenge their existing beliefs. We can't just tell them to stop being biased and expect it to work. It's important to listen to their point of view, acknowledge it, and then provide them with alternative perspectives and facts that can help them think about the issue in a different way. Only then can we hope to change someone's opinion and have a meaningful discussion.

It can be difficult to convince people of your true character, especially in a professional setting. The best way to do this is to focus on your actions and the way you interact with people. Show that you are a team player and that you respect the opinions of others. Be willing to listen to their feedback and take it into consideration. Demonstrate that you are willing to work hard and be a positive contributor to the team. Above all, be honest and strive to be a good communicator. If you do these things, you should be able to prove to your colleagues that you are not a douchebag.

Hey everyone! 

I've finally finished my body spreadsheet and I'm so excited to share it with you all. I've been tracking my diet, exercise, and body measurements for a few months now and I'm ready to put it all together and see how I've progressed. I'm hoping to use this spreadsheet to stay motivated and keep on track with my fitness goals. 

I'm sure some of you have been doing something similar and I'd love to hear about your experiences and tips. I'm open to any feedback or advice you have to offer! 

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I'm not sure why you're asking this question on Reddit, but if you're looking for a fact-based explanation on a certain topic, perhaps a Google search is the way to go. There are plenty of reliable sources out there that can provide you with the information you need, without relying on quotes from movies.

It's easy to feel like you can never get ahead. Life can be overwhelming and it's easy to get stuck in a rut. But don't fall through the cracks or you are fucked. It's important to take care of yourself and make sure you have the resources you need to succeed. Reach out to friends, family, and other resources to get the help you need. Don't be afraid to ask for help and don't give up!

Hey, everyone.

I know that it can be really frustrating when you don't do as well as you'd like in League of Legends, but you need to stop crying about it. It's not going to do you any good to sit and wallow in your own misery.

Instead, take a step back and try to figure out what you could have done better. Maybe you could have taken a different path, or made different decisions. Maybe you could have communicated better with your team.

Whatever it is, take a few moments to reflect and then move on. Don't let your losses define you. And remember to have fun while you're playing. That's what League of Legends is all about.

Good luck, summoners!

Hey San Diego! 

It's easy to get caught up in our own lives and forget about the importance of being a good neighbor. We all have our own struggles and it can be hard to think of others, but it's important to remember that we're all in this together. 

Don't be a villain. Be kind and generous to your friends, family, and neighbors. Reach out to those in need and lend a helping hand. We all benefit when we work together and create a better community. 

Thanks for listening and have a great day!

"I recently had a conversation with a religious person who tried to explain why they believed in God. Their explanation was basically that God is the reason why everything exists, and that God is the source of all life.

I have to say, this explanation was really unsatisfying to me. It doesn't explain anything at all. It's just a statement that has no real meaning. It's like saying "The sky is blue because it's blue". It's balderdash.

What do you think? Do you think this explanation is satisfactory, or do you think it's balderdash too?"

It's no secret that fans of ARPGs like Path of Exile tend to be passionate about the game and often enjoy discussing it with others. However, it's important to remember that not everyone is a fan of the genre and may not be open to hearing the praise of the game. Preaching to the choir of course will induce an accord regardless of the strength of the argument, but if we take it to someone else, let's say showing his review to someone that doesn't like ARPG, it probably won't convince any of those people to seriously explore and enjoy the game.

Instead, it's important to approach the subject from a different angle. Explain why the game is enjoyable in a way that doesn't rely on the player's familiarity with the genre. Talk about the game's unique features, its story, and its replayability. Explain why you personally enjoy the game and why you think others would too. Most importantly, be respectful and understanding of the other person's opinion, even if they don't share your enthusiasm.

Makes your opponent commit resources first instead of you.

Have you ever been in a situation where you had a powerful card in hand, but were afraid to cast it first because your opponent might have a counter? Or maybe you had a great combo in hand, but you were worried that your opponent would stop it before you could execute it?

If so, then you should consider making your opponent commit their resources first before you commit yours. By making your opponent go first, you can assess their board state and decide whether or not it's safe to cast your powerful spells or execute your combo.

This strategy is especially effective when playing control decks, as they often rely on being able to counter or remove threats before they can become a problem. By making your opponent commit their resources first, you can ensure that they don't have the resources to stop you.

Try it out and see how it works for you!

It's something that I've noticed in Magic: the Gathering. When you attack with a creature, you want to make sure that your opponent has as little information as possible when deciding which creature to block with. One way to do this is to play creatures with multiple abilities, such as flying, first strike, and trample. This way, your opponent won't know which ability you will use to attack with and will have to guess. Doing this can give you an edge in combat and make it harder for your opponent to make the correct blocking decision.

I'm a big baby and nerds make me mad. I don't understand why people like playing Magic: The Gathering so much. It seems like a waste of time and money. I don't understand why people would spend so much time and money on something that doesn't even have a tangible reward. It's just a bunch of cards and rules. I don't get it.

Hey everyone,

I'm new to Magic: The Gathering and I'm having trouble understanding how to play certain cards. I know I've heard the acronym RTFM before, but what does it mean when it comes to playing a card?

I recently tried to play a card and realized I had misread the card and made a mistake. Is there a resource I can use to make sure I'm playing the card correctly?

Edit: Thanks for the help everyone. I guess I should have RTFM before I pay for the card!

Crossfit can be a great way to stay fit, but it's not for everyone. If you're having trouble finding success with Crossfit, you might want to look into the indoor rowing and Erg sprinting community. Both are great ways to stay active and get a full-body workout, and they don't require the same level of skill and technique as Crossfit. Plus, they're a great way to have fun and challenge yourself. Give them a try and see if they're a better fit for you!

"I was trying to be lazy and take a nap, so I decided to just lie down on the couch and not move. Little did I know, my cat had other plans. She decided to curl up against my back and then proceeded to knead my shirt with her claws. This caused my shirt to bunch up in certain places and created a puzzle-like pattern on my back.

I decided to try and figure out the pattern and see if I could solve it. After about four hours of trial and error, I finally solved the puzzle and my cat was very proud of herself.

It was actually a pretty fun and entertaining experience, and I'm glad I decided to give it a shot. Has anyone else ever had a similar experience?"

I got an IUD a few years ago and I'm so glad I did - it's been an incredibly convenient form of birth control for me. I haven't had any negative effects with mine, and I strongly advise getting one if you're looking for a reliable and hassle-free form of contraception. IUDs are very effective and you don't have to worry about taking a pill every day or remembering to use a condom. Plus, the insertion process wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

It's semen! I know it sounds strange, but semen has actually been used for medicinal purposes for centuries. It's been used to treat a variety of ailments, including impotence, infertility, and even depression. It's believed that semen contains hormones that can help regulate mood and increase libido. While there's still much to be learned about the potential therapeutic effects of semen, there's no denying that it can have a positive effect on your health. So if you're looking for an all-natural and effective way to improve your wellbeing, semen might just be the answer.

Hey everyone,

I've been playing Runescape for a few months now, and I'm looking for some help with a specific issue I'm having. I'm having trouble with my character's combat stats, and I'm not sure what to do. I've been trying to read up on combat stats, but it's all a bit overwhelming.

I'm looking for some advice from experienced players on how to improve my combat stats. Could you please give me some more specific details on what I should be doing? I suggest reading my entire comment for better help from me and others :)

Thanks in advance!

I recently had the pleasure of playing an amazing game of Dungeons and Dragons with some of my closest friends. One of the characters was a former criminal, and he ended up becoming a great ally and friend to our group. 

At one point in the game, our group was in a desperate situation and it seemed like there was no way out. We had been fighting a powerful enemy for several days and it seemed like we were going to lose. That's when my former criminal friend stepped up and sacrificed himself to save me and the rest of the group. 

It was an incredibly emotional moment, and it really showed the power of friendship and the bonds that can be formed between characters in a role-playing game. I'll never forget that moment, and the sacrifice my friend made to save us all.

As someone who loves science and space exploration, this is really interesting! It's amazing to think that something as small and seemingly insignificant as paintballs could be used to deflect an asteroid. It's also amazing to think that all of the world's nuclear weapons wouldn't even make a dent in an asteroid that's much smaller and lighter than the one in Armageddon. It's definitely a funny thought, but it's also a great reminder of how powerful and destructive nuclear weapons can be.

What is the craziest thing you've ever seen someone do in a public restroom?

I was in a public restroom once and saw a man in full military fatigues, complete with a helmet and camouflage paint, go into a stall and start doing push-ups. He then proceeded to do a few jumping jacks and some other exercises before exiting the stall and leaving the restroom. I guess he was a member of the Toilet Troopers!

Payload bay makes it impossible in this airframe design. I'm designing a new aircraft and the payload bay is too large for the airframe I have designed. It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. I'm trying to figure out a way to make it work, but so far nothing has worked out. Any suggestions?

"I was in high school and was feeling pretty brave one day. I decided to try to jump over the bleachers in the gym. I got up a good head of steam and jumped, but unfortunately I didn't make it. Instead, I landed right on top of three cheerleaders who were sitting on the bleachers. Needless to say, they were not happy and I was completely humiliated. I still cringe when I think about it."

I've been a fan of Doctor Who for many years now, and one of the things I love the most about the show is the companions. Each companion brings something unique to the table, and I can honestly say I love them all. Whether it's Rose's bubbly enthusiasm, Martha's intelligence, Donna's sass, or Rory's loyalty, each companion brings something to the show that makes it even better. 

I never find myself changing the channel when a new companion or Doctor arrives, because I know the show will be just as exciting and entertaining as ever. I never judge a companion or Doctor based on their looks, their attitude, or their intelligence, because I know that each of them has something special to offer to the show. 

So, no matter who is the companion or Doctor, I will always be there to watch and enjoy. I love every companion and Doctor, and I never will you hear me say "Ugh changed the channel, he/she is too boring/whiny/stupid/worish/ugly etc."

I don't know about you, but I still remember the original Aliens vs. Predator from 1999. It was a great game, and it's still one of my favorites. The graphics were amazing for its time, and the gameplay was incredibly immersive. It was one of the few games that truly captured the feeling of the movies. 

Unfortunately, the game has not aged well. The graphics are outdated, and the controls are clunky. But the biggest issue is that it's not available on modern computers. It would be great if someone could port the original AVP to modern computers, so that we can all enjoy it once again. It would be a great way to relive the classic game, and it would be a great way to introduce modern gamers to the classic AVP.

I don't think you understood the argument I was making before you decided to disagree. I was arguing that the current system of government is not working, and that we need to find a better way to ensure that our voices are heard and our needs are met. It's not about disagreeing with one another, it's about finding a way to work together to create a better future for all of us.

I'm sure I'm not alone in this, but when I stop worrying about being productive and just focus on getting things done, I find that I'm actually more productive. I think it's because when I'm worrying about being productive, I'm usually trying to do too many things at once and end up accomplishing nothing. When I just focus on the task at hand, I find that I'm able to get more done in less time. Plus, there's less stress involved!

I recently started taking tramadol for my fibromyalgia pain and I didn't realize it could cause over heating and flushing. I was in the middle of a hot yoga class and all of a sudden I started to feel really hot and my face was bright red. I had to leave the class early and I was so embarrassed. Luckily I had taken the tramadol that morning so I knew what was causing it. Has anyone else experienced this side effect?

It looks like we might be in trouble. The coronavirus is spreading faster than ever before, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to contain it. We need to take drastic measures to stop the spread, but it might already be too late. 

On top of that, if you're feeling sick, you need to wear a mask. It's one of the most basic steps we can take to protect ourselves and those around us. So if you're feeling unwell, please do the right thing and put on a mask. It could save lives.

Hey everyone,

I've been playing Runescape for a while and I've noticed that a lot of people seem to think that they need expensive armor or flipping/hosting to make money. This isn't true! Armor isn't any more expensive than it used to be, and Chaotics are free these days. Even if you don't flip or host, you aren't poor - there are a ton of ways to make good money in Runescape that don't require expensive prerequisites.

Flipping and hosting are perfectly legitimate methods of making money, but they don't have to be the only way. If you feel like you're being lazy because you don't want to invest the time and money in flipping and hosting, don't worry - there are plenty of other ways to make money that don't require such a big investment.

So don't worry - even if you don't have the money to invest in flipping or hosting, you can still make good money in Runescape. Just take the time to explore the different options available to you, and you'll be able to make money without breaking the bank. Good luck!

It's no secret that healthcare in the US is expensive. But what's even scarier is the fact that taxes are an afterthought when seeking medical attention and services.

I recently had to take my father to the emergency room after he suffered a heart attack. We spent several hours in the ER, and when it was all said and done, we had a bill for over $10,000. After insurance, we were still left with a bill of over $2,000.

When I got the bill, I was expecting to see a line item for taxes. But there was none. It was only after I asked the hospital about it that I found out that taxes don't apply to medical services.

It's just another example of how broken our healthcare system is. We pay an exorbitant amount for medical services, and then don't even get taxed for it. It's just another way for the wealthy to keep their money and leave the rest of us to foot the bill.

My grandfather recently went in for heart surgery. Unfortunately, he ended up catching a drug resistant staph infection in his chest cavity. He's been in the hospital for a few weeks now, and the doctors don't seem to have any answers as to how he got it. I'm so scared for him, and I'm just hoping that he can make a full recovery. Has anyone else ever experienced something like this?

I recently had a staph boil and let me tell you, it was one of the most painful experiences of my life. It's something I wouldn't wish on anyone.

So I'm here to remind everyone that hygiene is important. Whether it's washing your hands, taking regular showers, or wearing clean clothes, taking care of your body is essential.

It's easy to forget to be hygienic, especially when you're a kid, but it's something that can save you from a lot of pain and discomfort. So please, keep yourself clean and healthy!

As someone who is in a non-monogamous relationship, I know how important it is to feel safe, secure, recognized, appreciated, desired, etc. during group sex. It can be intimidating to be in a situation with multiple partners, and feeling at ease is essential for the experience to be enjoyable.

One way to ensure that you feel safe and secure is to communicate openly and honestly with your partner and the other people involved. Talk about boundaries and expectations beforehand and make sure everyone is on the same page.

Another way to make sure your needs are being met is to focus on the connection between you and your partner. If you feel that your needs are being satisfied by your partner, even while they are with another person, you might not feel as jealous.

Finally, it's important to take care of yourself during group sex. Make sure you're comfortable and relaxed, and that your needs are being met. If something doesn't feel right, speak up and let your partner know.

Group sex can be an incredibly rewarding and fulfilling experience, but it's important to make sure you feel safe, secure, recognized, appreciated, and desired. With proper communication and self-care, you can make sure that your needs are being met and that you are having a positive experience.

You'll definitely enjoy doing it, so go for it! There are lots of different types of airsoft guns, so you can find something that fits your budget and your play style.

This is an interesting question. It's true that many people are on multiple sites, but why? It could be for a variety of reasons. 

For starters, people may be on multiple sites to expand their social network. They may be looking to meet new people with similar interests, or to keep up with friends or family members who are on other sites. 

Another reason someone may be on multiple sites is to keep up with different topics. For example, someone may use one site to stay up to date on politics, and another to stay informed about the latest tech news. 

Some people may also use multiple sites for entertainment. They may use one site for gaming, and another for watching videos or streaming music. 

Finally, people may be on multiple sites to stay in touch with their professional network. They may use one site to network with colleagues, and another to stay up to date on job postings. 

In short, there are many legitimate reasons why someone may be on multiple sites. Everyone has their own reasons and motivations, so it's important to respect their choices.

I recently had a customer call in who was having trouble with their computer. They told me that they had been trying to fix the issue for days but nothing was working. After a few minutes of troubleshooting, I finally found the issue and solved it.

The customer was so grateful and thanked me profusely. As they were thanking me, they said something that really resonated with me. They said, "You know, it's not the technology that's hard to use, it's the people who don't know how to use it."

It really made me think about how true that statement is. Technology is supposed to make our lives easier but it can be difficult when people don't know how to use it. That's why tech support is so important!

Hey everyone, 

I recently got into a discussion with another member of a chatroom about how Gilda from My Little Pony has a wall thicker than Pink from Pink Floyd's The Wall. We got into a deep philosophical discussion about what magic is and how it relates to Quantum Physics and String Theory. 

It was a fascinating conversation and I wanted to see what other people thought about it. Do you think Gilda's wall is thicker than Pink's? Do you think there's a connection between magic and Quantum Physics and String Theory? Let me know what you think in the comments!

It happens to me all the time. I'm out for a walk, and I find myself drawn to a tree. I don't even think about it, I just walk up to it and give it a hug. It's like I'm drawn to it, like it's calling me.

But I do it intentionally. I'm drawn to trees because they're a source of peace and tranquility. I find myself feeling calmer and more at ease when I'm around them. I find myself taking a few moments to just take in the beauty of the tree and appreciate its presence.

It's a ritual I've been doing for years now, and it's something that I look forward to doing. Trees are a reminder to me that nature is beautiful and that it's important to take a moment to appreciate it.
