Shifting seasonal time is no longer worth it. With the advancement of technology, the need to adjust the time twice a year is no longer necessary. The energy savings that was once thought to be a benefit is now negligible in the grand scheme of things. Moreover, the disruption to our daily routines and the potential health issues that come with the changing of the clocks are not worth the minor energy savings. It's time to end the practice of seasonal time shifting and keep our clocks set to the same time all year round.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/math with title ""Shifting seasonal time is no longer worth it.""","I think it should be fixed on either UTC standard or UTC+1 year around, with the current zone offsets.

Moving timescales add a lot of complexity to the implementation of timekeeping systems and have [dubious value]( 

I think seasonal shifting time made sense in the pre-electric past, when timekeeping was more flexible and artificial light was inefficient and often dangerous. 

Now we have machines that work easily with simple timekeeping rules, and it's more beneficial to spend a small amount on energy for lighting, and save the larger cost of engineering things to work with the complex timekeeping rules, as well as saving the irritation to humans.

Lighting has gotten much more efficient over time; we can squeeze out a lot more photons per unit of energy from a 2012 CFL or LED than a candle could in 1780, or a lightbulb could in 1950. 

There's a lot of room for improvement in how we use lights as well; as lighting control gets more intelligent, there will be a lot of savings from not illuminating inactive spaces constantly.

tl;dr: Shifting seasonal time is no longer worth it."

I'm not sure why people feel the need to share their personal opinions on every issue. It's like, just because you think something is true, doesn't mean it is. Everyone has a different opinion and perspective, and that's totally fine. But it's not cool to just throw your opinion out there without any facts or evidence to back it up. That's just, like, personal opinions 'n shit.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/funny with title ""Personal opinions 'n shit.""","Art is about the hardest thing to categorize in terms of good and bad. To consider one work or artist as dominate over another comes down to personal opinion. Sure some things maybe blatantly better than other works, but it ultimately lies with the individual.

CLET tends to use the same images continuously (to a point where one could say ""Is this it?"") as do most street artists (I do think this term is thrown around a lot more than it should be, I agree with you there) and it can be annoying.

It's really sad that joysticks have become passe in modern games. I remember when I was younger, I would spend hours playing games with a joystick. I loved being able to control the game with more precision than a keyboard and mouse. 

It's a shame that joystick support has become so rare in modern games. The only games that seem to support them are flight sims, which makes sense, but it's still disappointing. It's a reminder of how much gaming has changed over the years. 

I understand that game developers have to make decisions based on what the majority of people want, but I still wish joysticks were more widely supported in modern games. It would be great to be able to use a joystick to play games like first-person shooters or racing games. 

It's a shame that joysticks have become passe in modern gaming, but hopefully developers will start to recognize the need for better joystick support.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/gamingpc with title ""Yes, Joysticks in modern games have apparently become passe unless you are playing a flight sim and that sucks.""","In Mechwarrior Online, I have begun to use a mouse for the ""turret"" aspect of the torso twist/tilt and a Logitech G13 for other controls (  The G-13 has a little thumbstick that works well for WASD functions and has a little keyboard to cover all the other (limited) controls required for MWO.  For modern games, I guess that's as close to HOTAS as they want you to get.  For a better solution, I think that with a joystick emulating mouse inputs it would be passable, but as you said:  It's presently a sad day and you have to be able to edit XML files to modify joystick input triggers and it starts becoming an occupation rather than a gaming hobby.  In Mechwarrior 2, 3, &amp; 4 I use the Steel Battalion controller and it is freaking awesome to have the three axes of torso twist, tilt, walking direction, plus a real throttle, plus real hat switches for views, plus pedals for extra speed, stopping power and jumpjet control.  Not to mention the 32 other buttons and the flip cover over the eject button.  Check this control map by Baron Von Pilsner ( and look at my original posts for links to my Fully Enclosed Mech Simulator on Mechwarrior Online's forums for details.

Hey everyone, 

I've been playing Diablo 3 for a while now and I've noticed that some of the higher level monsters seem to be dropping class-only items. Has anyone else noticed this? I'm wondering if this is a bug or something that was intentionally put in the game. Any thoughts?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Diablo with title ""Class only items dropped from high-lvl monsters.""","You are talking about the Charsi imbue, right? Or a cube upgrade?
If we are talking Charsi imbue, you can only imbue WHITE items. This includes superior, but they will not neccesarily be superior after imbuing (they get random base-modifications). Bloodfist and Gorefoot are both uniques (gold), and therefore not eligible for imbuing.
When you imbue, the item level matters (the item level is hidden). The item is the same level as the monster who dropped it. That means, that the higher level the monster who dropped it, the more stats is available on that item. It is important to note that an item doesn't neccesarily use all it's stat potential. This means that the same item dropped in a1 and a2 can has the possibility of some very different outcomes.
After the imbue, the item can be as good as if the monster itself had dropped a rare (yellow) item. Imbued weapons will always turn out as rare items.
To answer your question, you should just progress like you are now, fighting the hardest monsters you can. When a potential good white item appears, try to imbue that. Class specifiq items has a better chance to give +skills to your class. Circlets has the higest bonuses regarding yellow items. And you can get an extra base stat advantage by using exceoptional (nightmare) items, which will drop in a4-5 from time to time. You can check out monster levels, and item qualities (normal, exceptional, elite) on arreat summit ofc. :)


EDIT (forgot infoz):
In cases of imbue-eligible items with base bonuses (maces, wands, staffs and class specifique items, and any other item with +skills etc.) will loose their current bonuses due to the base item reroll. They can get extra skills from the base item AND the rarity class. Say, if you imbue a staff with +1 fireball, it will reroll that base staff. It might turn out with a staff with +1 icebolt and +1 warmth, and then you add the bonuses the rarity would give you, lets say +1 icebolt and +1 fireball. Then your +1 fireball staff will have turned into a +2 icebolt +1 fireball staff. It might as well turn into any other staff allowed by it's item lvl though.

As far as I recall, weapon damage and defense values are not rerolled. I am not 100% positive on this though. Haven't played d2 for a looong time :P

TLDR: Class only items dropped from high-lvl monsters."

Hey Laqueristas!

I recently purchased OPI's Nail Envy and I'm absolutely in love with it. It's a great base coat that strengthens and hardens your nails while also protecting them from chipping and breaking. It's really easy to apply and it dries quickly. It also gives your nails a nice glossy finish.

I'm so glad I decided to try out this product. I'm definitely going to be using it regularly now!

Has anyone else tried this product? What are your thoughts?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/RedditLaqueristas with title ""OPI Nail Envy!""","All but one of my nails were in the ballpark of 1 1/8"" - 1 1/2"" long when my ring finger nail broke to the quick on Monday!

As a side note, I used to be a **serious** nail biter all through my childhood and high school. I have had occasional relapses in my adulthood as well, but the point I'm trying to make is that my nail beds are *really* short, and I think my nails that short show about 1/8"" of my fingertips and look so sad!

I'm sure I'm not alone in this, but I'm one of those people who doesn't drive like most people in major cities. I rely on public transportation to get around, and I'm really hoping that iOS6 Maps will include public transit directions. It would be incredibly helpful to have the ability to quickly and easily get directions to places using public transportation, instead of having to look up separate transit maps and schedules. I'm sure I'm not the only one who would appreciate this feature, so please Apple, make it happen!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/apple with title ""I don't drive like  most  people in major cities, and need public transit directions integrated in iOS6 Maps.""","I could give a shit about turn by turn directions because I never drive and the new maps doesn't have ANY public transportation directions which is just complete bullshit -- especially for a company that is supposedly ""green"" conscious.

It has integrated bus routes/schedules and train schedules and as someone else pointed out in another thread about this subject, you will need another 3rd party app if you go to a city other than your own, instead of easily being able to get directions as you travel. 

I would also argue that since NYC of all places has a pretty shitty selection of 3rd party options, that the available options in other smaller major cities would be significantly shittier.

Hey everyone, 

We wanted to take a moment to talk about how we make money and how we involve everyone in the process. We're a film production company, so we make money by producing films and selling them to distributors. We also make money from the sales of our films, including DVD, Blu-ray, streaming, and other digital formats.

We involve everyone in the process of making our films. We have a team of producers, writers, directors, actors, and crew members who all work together to create the best films possible. We also involve our fans in the process. We have a forum where fans can post their ideas and feedback, and we use that to help shape our films.

We hope this answers your question about how we make money and how we involve everyone in the process. We appreciate your support and look forward to making more great films in the future!

The Reddit Films Production Team","give me the text of a reddit post from r/RedditFilmsProduction with title ""How we make money?

Otherwise the turnover rate of artists skyrockets. 

My secondary concern is keeping this as open, transparent, and democratic as possible. Reddit's strength is in the hive, for better or worse, and I'd hate to relegate decisions to a few of us who happen to live in LA. From the get-go this needs to be a global initiative.

I recently had an experience that I wanted to share with all of you. I was walking my dog in the park the other day when I noticed a group of people playing a sport. I noticed that one of the players had a dog with them that seemed to be neglected. The dog was not properly taken care of and was not being given enough attention.

I was walking into the sliding door and said ""Hey Pup!"" and patted him on the head. At that point I was bitten and grabbed, as you know those jaws are bred for, I am sure.

I blamed the father of my friend who owned him who disregarded the dog as a pet and trained him in a small backyard with children to fight, hunt, starve and get rained on, etc. The poor dog had to be quarantined for a few days because of the supposed snake bite encounter, and I got threats from the owner saying I roughed up his dog and got him going, which i most certainly did not.

I'm sure many of us can relate to this. Just because you were close ""at times"" in a best of 5 series that you lost 6 games in, doesn't mean you didn't get stomped.

As soon as I was facing the opposite direction, I see my sister in a chair, dead, eyes open but lifeless, and fucking Slender Man behind her, and even with his featureless face, I could sense every bit fear-inducing aura built up within him as if he'd done this same thing to thousands of people in their nightmares since the dawn of man.  I yelled out her name in the dream, waking myself up with the sound of me actually yelling it in the real world.  I shot straight up in my bed, sobbing, yelling out my sister's name as if it were something from a movie.  That one nightmare singlehandedly scared me more than anything else in my entire life.

TL;DR - Fuck Slender Man."

I'm not sure how to answer this question, as it's not a real post. However, if this were a real post, it might read something like this:

I recently had a dream where I had to sacrifice my daughter to save the universe, and then I was violently raped in my own home by my parents. Both of these events felt as real as reality when I woke up and was fully sober. 

I'm not sure what to make of this dream, or why I had it. Has anyone else had a similar experience? What did you do to make sense of it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""Butchered daughter to save the universe and was violently raped for house by my parents, both of which felt as real as reality when awake and sober.""","I take a beta blocker for my heart condition that not only makes me have crazy dreams, they can feel more real than reality.  2 dreams come to mind which were fucked up.

I knew it was fucked up, but I honestly believed what the alien was saying so to save the universe I butchered my daughter.  Now that was pretty bad and all, but the first really bad dream I had on the beta blocker has stuck with me just as much.  In it I was at my parents house with all of us dressed in bdsm gear.

At that point my feet wouldn't move and my parents gradually walked up to me before violently raping me.

My eyes slowly opened as I tried to shake off the grogginess of sleep.  Immediately, I was filled with a sense of dread and discomfort, and my surveillance of my surroundings did little to comfort me.  I was naked, laying on a large operating table made entirely of cold stainless steel.  The room I found myself in was completely empty, save for my metal platform, with the wall that my feet were towards being made of glass.  On the other side of the glass was my mother, talking nervously with some doctors and looking more and more hysterical as they attempted to comfort her.  My voice caught in my throat as I tried to call out, and my legs refused to budge as if welded to the steel.  At this moment, I noticed the single most excruciating pain I've felt in my life, and collapsed back onto the table.  I looked down at my chest, and saw a gaping, gory, bleeding chasm stretching from my collar bone down to my belly button.  I could feel my stomach turn, for as I looked closer, the inside of my chest was hollowed, as if I'd been cleaned like some game.  With uneasy trepidation, I plunged my right hand down, further and further into my chest, looking desperately for any organs that would remain.  For how could I live without them?  My hand returned, sheathed in a thick coating of blood, at which point I lost the ability to breathe.  A cold wind swept over my body as I curled up, a pool of blood now leaking from the massive hole in my chest that I knew I couldn't fix.  I would die here.  Cold, alone, sad, and afraid.  

Though the dream lasted little more than two minutes, I can recall every second with complete and total detail.  It was so vivid, that when I came out of anesthesia I kept asking the doctors and my parents about it, convinced the whole ordeal had been real.

I recently had a series of seemingly unrelated events that revealed a lot about how selfish I am. 

The first was when I was talking to a friend and they were telling me about a recent tragedy in their life. I found myself not really caring or even listening to what they were saying. I was more focused on my own problems and didn't really care about what was going on in their life. 

The second was when I was at the grocery store and I saw an elderly woman struggling to carry her groceries. I didn't offer to help her, I just kept walking and didn't think twice about it. 

The third was when I was out with a group of friends and one of them was having a hard time. I was more focused on myself and my own needs than trying to help them out. 

All of these events made me realize that I am a very selfish person. I don't think about others and their needs as much as I should and I don't take the time to help out when I should. It's something that I need to work on and I'm going to try to be more selfless in the future.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""series of unrelated fucked up things reveals that I'm a very selfish person.""","Long one, 

I was in Walmart, being chased by a man whom I knew was going to rape me/cause me serious bodily harm. Said Walmart became a maze and was increasingly hard to navigate, then I come upon my ex boyfriend in the yarn section (which I'm not sure exists in Walmart stores) and he refused to help me. He said, ""You deserve what is happening to you"". So I'm running out of breath, feeling terrified, knowing I'm going to be caught when I see the door and run outside. 

It's raining, and very dark out. Two of my professors are out in the parking lot, one is crying and staring off into the distance. I follow her gaze to see this terrible scene: A bridge over a gaping ravine has collapsed and cars are still driving off the edge and crashing into the river beneath. People are dying right before my eyes, screaming, crying. My ears are filled with a terrible screeching sound louder than any other sobbing and I'm suddenly underneath the bridge looking up. 

I turn around and there's a little girl laying on the river-bank, she's making the screeching sound. I can see blood everywhere but begin to panic when I can't find why she's making this horrifying noise. I place my hands beneath her head and lift her face towards mine. Her eyes are all white and completely void of life. Her mouth grows wider as she screeches and her jaw begins to unhinge. Her teeth grow into long silver  spikes that pierce her lips as they grow, finally her head tears in half completely. 

Once everything was silent and this 'girl' lay dead on the ground, I grew calm with the thought that it wasn't me that had to suffer.

I had a nightmare last night about almost killing a serial killer while he tried to kill me.

I was walking in an alleyway when I heard a noise behind me. I turned around and saw a man with a knife and a mask. He was coming after me and I was so scared. I was trying to run away but he kept coming closer. I finally managed to grab a brick and hit him over the head. He was still alive and trying to get up, so I hit him again and again until he finally stopped moving.

I recently made the mistake of listening to some dubstep right before I went to bed. It was a terrible idea! The loud, intense beats and heavy bass kept me up all night.

Everyone's dancing, partying, and people are popping pills. Loooots of drugs. Mostly pills though.  And then, right as the drop starts, huge floodlights on the ceiling turn on, illuminating the entire building.  Walls are bare, unpainted, white. Everyone in the building turns and stares at me. And then, simultaneously, they all scream, ""call 911 now!"" (the drop) and collapse at the same time.  They were dead before they hit the ground.  Blood starts coming out of their eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.  End of dream.  Go listen to the song, this'll make a bit more sense.

I'm a huge fan of raw denim and I'm here to tell you that you should never substitute straight leg denim for raw. Raw denim has a unique look and feel that you just can't get with any other type of denim. Straight leg denim is not the most flattering style and it can make you look bulky. Instead, look for slim or tapered denim that will give you a more flattering silhouette.

It's funny how life works: we're all in a race that we didn't know we were in. We're all competing to be the best versions of ourselves, to reach our goals and dreams, and to make our lives better. But sometimes, we don't even realize that we're in a race until we look back and see how far we've come.

It's easy to forget that life is a race and that each day is a new opportunity to make progress. But if you take the time to look back and evaluate your progress, you'll be able to see how far you've come and how much you've accomplished. And that's when you realize that you've been in a race all along.

It's often said that Team Fortress 2 is a game of skill, but I believe there isn't a definitive skill level, it's all relative to whom you're playing against.

For example, if you're playing against a team of players who are much more experienced than you, then you may feel like your skill level is lower than it actually is. On the other hand, if you're playing against a team of players who are much less experienced than you, then you may feel like your skill level is higher than it actually is.

It's all about perspective. The skill level of any player is relative to the skill level of the players they're playing against. So when it comes to Team Fortress 2, don't be too hard on yourself if you don't think you're good enough. You may actually be better than you think!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/tf2 with title ""There isn't a definitive skill level, it's all relative to whom you're playing against.""","There's no definitive line when it comes to hours or anything.

Generally, it's just how you perform compared to other people in the area you play most. If you're topscoring by a mile every match on a valve server, you'd be considered a relative pro. But just because you're a pro, doesn't mean you stop working at it. Find something you're bad at, make it better, and if you're good at one thing, find a better person to play against. If you're bored of valve, move to one of the server farms, and then keep moving up to some servers with experienced players, like STAR's server. From there, try lobbies, and competitive.

Hey everyone, 

I'm sure we can all agree that the term 'noob' gets thrown around a lot in TF2. But what does it really mean? A 'noob' is someone who acts without a plan and/or has insufficient skill to credibly execute their plans. You don't have to be amazing to stop being a noob - you just need to be able to present a credible challenge. 

For example, if you're new to the game and you're trying to learn how to play the Sniper class, you don't need to be a pro to make a difference. All you need to do is pay attention to what's going on around you, find a good spot to snipe from, and be able to hit your shots. 

So don't be discouraged if you're new to the game. Just remember to think before you act, and practice your skills until you can present a credible challenge. 

Thanks for reading, and have a great day!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/tf2 with title ""A 'noob' is someone who acts without a plan and/or has insufficient skill to credibly execute their plans. You don't have to be amazing to stop being a noob - you just need to be able to present a credible challenge.""","While I don't much support the term noob per se, I think the most useful definition of a player is their ability to understand and work in the team dynamic to push for victory. There are two main lessons a player must learn, and a bunch of secondary ones that stem from that.

Lesson 1: Play Well Individually

This is mostly the obvious part. If you're playing a sniper, get headshots, deal with counter sniping, and so on. Each class has their own foibles and learning curve. Engineer is probably the best class for the 'rote' aspects of this, as much of their early game strategy basically comes down to building perfectly at an optimal speed, like getting the sentry and dispenser up by the main spawn to cover the courtyard and both forward entries ASAP on round start. Other classes are more implicit, like knowing how to use the maps for scouts, spies, and soldiers. Knowing how to set an effective sticky trap.

You may not necessarily be great at a given class, but you migrate out of 'noob' territory in my book when it's clear your play mistakes are incidental rather than systemic. Got killed by a random enemy poking around a corner? Not a noob error. Missed a clutch shot and died in an important firefight? Happens to the best of us. Over-extend into a front line? Probably a noob mistake.

Lesson 2: Play Your Team

One thing I find really frustrating on many pub servers is that most people never really seem to get the idea of working together as a team. All classes have their strengths and weaknesses, and while you can go far on your own personal skill, the force multiplication of a coordinated effort is so huge that on pubs it is usually more important than skill unless it's entirely lopsided.

Obvious things are like picking classes that cover where the team is weak. There's also more subtle stuff, like if you have an engineer building a forward base, help guard the zone for a few seconds if you don't have an immediate priority target to reach. Understanding the dynamics of timing and supporting the moves your allies make is a gigantic step out of noobdom. See an uber? Follow it. Know a spy's getting in position to sap? Try to pull attention.

At a higher level of play, you can begin to perform some actions that would normally be somewhat noobish with deeper thought and skill in mind to achieve a bigger goal. For example, you're a scout and can afford to break ahead of your team's push of the fourth point, and the fifth is clear. But the other team is moving as a squad back to the other point. Do you cap or harass? This is a complex question, but there are times when the right answer is to run through their team to try and force a medic kill or at least slow their push enough to get the cap and give the rest of your team spare moments to reload for the fight.


tl;dr:

A 'noob' is someone who acts without a plan and/or has insufficient skill to credibly execute their plans. You don't have to be amazing to stop being a noob - you just need to be able to present a credible challenge."

Hey everyone, 

I'm sure a lot of you have heard of the Final Fantasy Tactics character Wiegraf. He's a villain who is pretty much universally despised by the fans. Well, I'm here to say that I think it's time to stop hating on this guy.

Yes, he was a villain. But he was also just a man trying to make the best of a bad situation. He was trying to make a better life for himself and his people, and that's something we should all be able to relate to.

So, let's stop hating on Wiegraf and start appreciating him for the complex character he was. He may have been a villain, but he was also a person with hopes and dreams. Let's give him the respect he deserves.

Thanks for reading!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/truegaming with title ""Fuck Wiegraf""","I have one very distinct memory of bad saves. In Final Fantasy Tactics, there's a boss encounter about 3/4ths of the way through the game that you have to fight with only your main character. It's at the end of a series of battles, meaning you can't move through the world map between them. The first time I ever played the game I got stuck here, I hadn't been staggering my saves, and saved over my only slot right after the first battle. I wasn't strong enough to defeat the boss and got stuck. I ended up having to restart from the beginning to beat him.

Fast forward to Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions on the PSP. I was well aware of the boss, but I wasn't sure where. I had staggered saves and I was making sure that I always had a backup save. Somehow when it came time to fight that boss again, I had messed up my staggered saves and gotten stuck again. I think there was a cutscene or something before the first battle that you could save at, I don't quite remember exactly how I messed it up. I could go back to the battle before but that didn't help too much. Stuck yet again, I gave up. Luckily I aced it when I played through the game again on the iPhone.

The best manual way to deal with it is to stagger saves over several slots, giving you X number of saves back from your current save. Ideally though you shouldn't have to think about it at all in a well-designed system. 

I wouldn't call your Dark Souls or FF issues related to bad saves. Those are both just part of the game that you have to deal with. A real bad save is one where you are stuck losing regardless of what you do.

It looks like the buffs to the Sweep/Smash spec in 1.4 are going to make it even more powerful in PvP. I don't want to give the impression that I think the Focus spec is totally broken, because it does have its weaknesses, like lack of sustain and nothing to fall back on if Smash doesn't hit. It's also very gear dependent, so with bad gear it can be really bad. But once you get good gear, it gets exponentially better because everything is focused down to a single bursty AOE attack that automatically crits and is kinetic damage. Knights can stack main stat, power, and surge, which explains the 6.7k+ hits. So, it wasn't broken before 1.4, but it was a bit too strong. Now it's getting buffed, which is a bit sad.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/swtor with title ""As if Sweep/Smash spec wasn't already borderline OP in PvP, prepare to see a lot more of them come 1.4 buffs.

Sadface.jpg""","Not sure if this change has been seriously discussed here but I think this is gonna be the biggest, most unbalancing change in PvP in 1.4. For the most part I liked the changes Bioware made to the other classes. Commandos &amp; Sages got buffs where they needed it, DPS Scoundrels got some love (though still not enough imo), and I'm even fine with the Assault Vanguard nerfs to be honest. But the buff to Focus spec baffled me for the longest time when I read it. I think if anything, most heavy PvPers (including Focus spec players) were expecting it to be hit with a nerf 1.4, instead it's the other way around.

Everyone knows Focus Guardians (and to a lesser extent Sentinels) do the expected insane amounts of total damage (AOE spec, no big surprise) but what's crazy is that they'll often also have the biggest single hit in warzones, because of the way they can Force Stasis/Choke (skill tree node) and Leap in (Vindicator set bonus) to get extra damage + guaranteed crit (skill tree node). I'm fully augmented WH with optimized mods/enhancements and I'm lucky to hit 5.5k against BM and above opponents. I've screenshots of Guardians doing up to 6.7k in those same warzones while also surpassing me in total damage. And Bioware is buffing them so they can Smash even *more* often?

It wasn't until I talked to a friend who does PvE (which I almost never do) that he explained it's a PvE buff. Focus spec lags super hard (around 15-20% according to DPS parsers) behind Vigilance for Guardians and the other 2 DPS trees for Sentinels in PvE. So they upping the frequency of Sweep to make up for this.

Here's where I see 2 problems:

1) I doubt this is even gonna fix the PvE issue. A big part of Focus specs problem in PvE is the fact it's AOE and it'll wake up and hit all CC'd targets along with taking threat away from the tank that the tank might not have heavily taunted/attacked at that point. I have a feeling most dedicated PvErs are still gonna stick with the other specs because it's safer and does damage just fine.

2) I understand in PvE, Focus spec is underwhelming against a boss with 500k - 1mill-k HP. The sustain just isn't there (pre 1.4). But in PvP burst is king and against players with 15k-20k health, hitting for 5k-6.5k damage every 15 seconds against everybody around them is VERY VERY GOOD. And now it's gonna get even better.

I'm just gonna go out on a limb and say next few weeks Warzones are gonna be a bit rough when more and more ppl realize how strong Focus spec is post 1.4 and until it becomes an obvious enough issue that Bioware needs to balance patch this.

Yes, it takes some practice, but with a little bit of time and effort, you can learn to play a ranged class like a pro.

First, make sure you understand the basics of your class. Learn the basics of your class's abilities, and how they interact with each other. Learn to position yourself properly and use your environment to your advantage.

Second, practice your rotation. Know which abilities to use in what order, and when to switch up your rotation for maximum effectiveness.

Finally, practice playing against other players. Learn how to read their movements and anticipate their actions. Learn to react quickly and appropriately to their strategies.

Once you've mastered the basics and gotten comfortable with your class, take it to the next level. Learn to play strategically, and use the tools at your disposal to outplay your opponents.

Good luck, and happy gaming!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/swtor with title ""learn to fucking play your RANGED (see ranged) class.""","&gt; Explain to me how to kite when they jump directly onto you immobilizing you?

stun after leap (imob is 1.5s iirc, GCD is 1.5s, do the math)

kite (see the attached slow; im assuming youre assault)

no ""good"" focus spec is going to double leap on one target just to, um, kill you. Try kiting away from your group and you neutralize the threat.

TL; DR: learn to fucking play your RANGED (see ranged) class."

I'm sure you've heard the argument that someone's behavior or mannerisms can be indicative of their sexuality.  I'm not here to dispute that, but I am asking for evidence or a reasonable argument to back up the claim. I understand that it may be difficult to provide concrete evidence, but if you're going to suggest someone is gay, then I think it's fair to ask for some kind of support for the claim. So, what do you have? I'm still waiting.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/atheism with title ""I get you think that through some fancy hand-waving suggesting the guy is gay (whether to his face or to each other) has some use.  I'm simply asking you to present evidence or a reasonable argument. 
 I'm still waiting.""","&gt; Like I said I don't know and do not have the expertise or education 

look, i appreciate our level of conversation but i think you can understand if i tell you this is getting annoying.  You keep saying it's important and insisting there is a role, but when I ask multiple times for more information you respond like this.  Look, if you don't have a reasonable argument to back it up, we can move on.  You're perfectly entitled to a point of view without evidence or reasonable argument.

&gt; i don't really believe that argumentation even works, directly

Fine then, what does suggesting this guy is closeted gay going to do indirectly?  Or at all?  

&gt;are much more effective, if not persuasive.

what is the indirect effect of suggesting this homophobe is a closeted gay?

&gt;again, you should be skeptical, but the study found that they tend to be gay

dude, it doesn't mean he's definitely gay. this is a fact. we don't know. it's likely that he is, according to the research, but again, i ask you, how is this of any use?  Accuse him of hypocrisy?  He'll simply deny it, and continuing to call him gay will transform your accusation into taunting--you are now being unreasonable bullying tactics.

So again, TL;DR: I get you think that through some fancy hand-waving suggesting the guy is gay (whether to his face or to each other) has some use.  I'm simply asking you to present evidence or a reasonable argument.

I'm still waiting."

I recently finished watching a popular anime adaptation of a manga, and I was really disappointed with the way it was handled. It felt like the anime was censored in some parts, and that the delivery of the story was lacking compared to the manga. It almost felt like the anime was biased towards the manga, and that the anime was trying to make up for the shortcomings of the manga. It's really unfortunate to see this kind of thing happen in an adaptation.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/anime with title ""A mix of censoring, lacking delivery and bias towards the manga.""","Tower of heaven wasn't great mainly because it was the last arc to feature the bad reused animations for attacks and such, and the lack of blood that becomes a real mood killer when Erza has her first real major battles that would need it.

Oracion Seis on the other hand was just a huge let down on delivering the story. The thing is my opinion on this arc might be a little biased, as at this point I ran out of episodes and changed to reading the manga. Then when coming back to watch the episodes it was more evident what factors were missing from the anime and that affected my views on the series. Now obviously it had its moments, Jura's fight with Hoteye was very well made, but especially the fights on the later stages seemed much worse on anime format. Lucy's and Erza's fights were not that well done and the final fight was made a wee bit too corny compared to the manga. 

But the real killer was the fact that the anime's delivery of the emotional stuff at the end was just plain worse than the manga's. That could be because I had already known of the coming plot twists, but that hasn't really mattered in any other anime I've watched thus far, nor did it affect my reactions in the Edolas scenes, which in truth were not as sad as the one in the end of Oracion Seis.

**TL;DR:** A mix of censoring, lacking delivery and bias towards the manga."

We all know that drugs are a bad way to try to get a boost in life. But what if there were some natural highs that we could create for ourselves that would give us the same feeling of accomplishment and joy? 

One way to do this is to set physical goals for yourself. Whether it's joining a gym, running a 5k, or lifting weights, having a physical goal and working towards it can be a great way to create a natural high. Not only will you be able to feel the satisfaction of achieving something, but you'll also be able to reap the physical benefits of being healthier. 

Another way to create a natural high is to set something like a personal challenge. This could be anything from learning a new language to trying a new hobby. Whatever it is, setting a goal and striving to achieve it can give you a sense of accomplishment and pride that drugs can't. 

So if you're looking for a way to get a boost in life, why not try to create your own natural highs? You'll be able to feel the satisfaction of achieving something without having to resort to drugs.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/relationship_advice with title ""create your own natural highs. Gym - get a physical goal. Drugs are the lazy, trashy, and tacky way to be something you're not.""","She's been honest with you the entire time. And it's all about the drugs.

What are your goals besides drugs? Why can't you be happy with yourself and not rely on a pill and a high to make you happy? Why not take up a sport, running or even skydiving? You know, something that actually accomplishes life and you can share your experience with anyone anywhere?

You'd really impress her if you cut most of those out. Why should she invest in you if you end up getting thrown in jail, overdose on something, or ruin your health.

She definitely cares about you more than you know, and that's kinda hot. But you're not seeing it. You could have an amazing future with this beautiful girl and you're willing to throw it away for some ""high"" with your friends. 

You have a lot to be thankful for with her, and I don't think the pills are worth it.

My girlfriend and I have been on and off for the past few years. We keep breaking up and getting back together, but it never works out. We know it's not healthy for either of us, but we keep doing it.

I'm starting to realize that it's not worth it. We keep hurting each other and nothing ever gets resolved. I want to stay together, but I'm not sure if it's the right thing to do.

I need advice on how to stop getting back together when it doesn't work out. How can I make sure that this time it's for good?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/relationship_advice with title ""Stop getting back together when it doesn't work out.""","You love yourself more than her.  That's not inherently wrong, at your age this is natural.  You should probably leave her though because you will hurt her in the end.  I won't advocate changing yourself to her expectations because I think her expectations do not take you into account either.  I think both of you would be better off with more compatible people.

I use drugs a lot like you do.  I'm not opposed to a bump of coke or two a couple times a year when it's around, I'll eat some mushrooms on a camping trip in the woods every couple years or so for a good cerebral dump and wipe, I smoke marijuana fairly regularly it's a good way to unwind with a beer at the end of the day, I drink beer and have begun brewing my own because it's a fun hobby, and I enjoy smoking cigars with my dad or my uncles when we have time to visit.  My girlfriend and I live together and I've never pushed anything on her.  She is aware of how I take my pleasure by the dose sometimes.  She enjoys beer, and has taken an interest in brewing so we have a shared hobby, and the occasional toke, but has no interest in other drugs.  I don't need her to take drugs to validate myself, and she doesn't require me to abstain to appease her own self-interest.  We are compatible and sensible with each other.  This is how we are and I wouldn't change her, and she doesn't need to change me.

However I have a problem with your story.  Why do you feel the need to validate yourself by pressuring her to use these substances the way you do?  It's obvious she has no interest.  On the other hand she is asking the same of you from a different perspective, that you abstain like her.  It's obvious you have no interest to change either.

There's your answer, staring you right in the face.  If you have experienced such incompatibility on such regular intervals over the same issue which neither of you have an interest in changing, then stop beating yourself up.  Give up on this rollercoaster because it is emotionally draining and hurtful for both of you.  You are young, probably intelligent, and have a lot of time ahead of you.  Learn from this and be yourself.  You are yourself, she is herself, and if either has to change to fit the other's expectations, when these expectations are unreal, then be yourself by yourself and not what she wants you to be.  I don't think you're going to be able to compromise with your current attitude about drugs.  You need to find somebody less hung up on your drug use, and you also need to reexamine why you need her so badly to ""try before you say no"" to validate your own use.  You yourself validate your own actions, no one else.  Own that and get yourself out of this relationship before you damage yourselves even further.  

There are millions of other girls out there who could make a better match for you.  Probably an older you, because I think I've been you and I think you still have some growing up to do before you commit to long term relationships especially ones as emotionally draining as this one.  You're only 23 and you've been with her since 18?  I've seen this happen in my own friends' relationships and it's usually an impediment to adulthood.  Think about it, you've been together since you were children.  You've become emotionally dependent on each other even though you're both growing up into very different adults.  Time to move on and into your own adulthood and stop holding each other back.  It can be an amicable break, time shared in love is very meaningful and will stay with you both forever, but every good thing must come to an end and you've postponed that point for too long now. 

TL;DR: Stop getting back together when it doesn't work out."

Hey everyone, 

I recently read an article discussing the differences between the birth control pill today and the one available in the 1960s. While I'm all for it being somewhat more accessible than it was then, I'm a little concerned about the side effects. From what I read, it seems like the pill today is a hormonal whopper with some pretty serious side effects. 

I'm not trying to start a debate or anything, I'm just curious to hear what other people have experienced with the pill. Has anyone else had to deal with these side effects? Is there anything I can do to minimize them? 

Thanks for any advice you can offer! 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who actually sent me thoughtful replies instead of going ""no she's wrong, downvote herp derp"".","give me the text of a reddit post from r/TwoXChromosomes with title ""is I'm all for it being somewhat more easily accessible than it was then, but if it's the same pill, it's definitely a hormonal whopper with side effects.

It screwed up my periods completely (I got them every 2 weeks for months, and even prescribing me the regular BC pill didn't fix it).

""It's Marketing! Get affiliated with good celebrities and you can get more votes through them. 

Whether you're running for office, working on a campaign, or just trying to get your message out there, having a celebrity endorsement can be a great way to get more votes. Celebrities have a lot of influence and their fans often listen to what they say. By aligning yourself with a celebrity who people trust and admire, you can tap into their fan base and increase your chances of getting more votes. So if you're looking to get more votes, don't forget to reach out to celebrities!""","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AdviceAnimals with title ""It's Marketing! Get affiliated with good celebrities and you can get more votes through them.""","I'm warning for a wall of text here.

Actually there's quite a good explanation for this phenomenon. This is what we in marketing call branding. That is the creation of a brand. A brand in turn is ""A person, name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers."" This is according to the american marketing association. Now in this case it has to do with personal branding. 

Rein, Kotler and Stoller (1987) define a celebrity as as ”A person whose name has attention-getting, interest-riveting, profit generating value”. By using a celebrity for endorsement in campaigns you can achieve something called co-branding. That means that the name of a celebrity is used to endorse a particular politician or party. This is the same as what Nike for example does with Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods for example. They use their names, big names in their particular fields, to endorse endorse different kinds of products to give them more exposure. 

Say that you want to sell a shoe. If you see two ads, one with just the shoe and one with Michael Jordan (or whatever celebrity you know of) you are by more or less always going to pay more attention to the one with the celebrity.

Alright so now we've covered the basics. Now we are coming to word of mouth or as we are here online we are talking about word of mouse. Because of the nature of politics, by that I mean that it's an area which very few people actually know that much about and the information can be ambiguous, they look to so called opinion leaders. These opinion leaders can be more or less anyone. For example Steven Colbert, Bill O'Riley,Engadget, Ray W Johnson or what ever ... someone people look to for some kind of information they are too lazy to find out themselves and which give them the information they think they need.

Now say that you know jack shit about politics and you are ha huge fan of Madonna, then you'll most probably think that Madonna probably is on to something. So instead of finding stuff out yourself you vote like Madonna, because you ""know"" Madonna and you like her, so she's probably right. That means that Madonna is your opinion leader in this case. Same goes for basically all other brands, both for intangible and tangible ""products"".

I could probably continue writing about this stuff all day but I think you get the picture from this.

Tl;dr It's Marketing! Get affiliated with good celebrities and you can get more votes through them."

Beds in the Nether are never a good idea. The Nether is full of dangerous mobs and hostile environments, so sleeping in a bed there is just asking for trouble.

I'm sure many of us are familiar with the idea of 'DPS' as the end-all-be-all of character builds in Diablo 3. But I think it's important to remember that there are other important aspects of a build that need to be taken into account before you can get the most out of your DPS.

For example, Crowd Control (CC) abilities are essential for crowd control, allowing you to manage the battlefield and keep your enemies at bay. The Law of Havoc (LoH) is a great way to increase your damage output against multiple targets, while also providing some CC. And finally, the Armor of the Ancients (APoC) is an often-overlooked defensive tool that can provide an extra layer of protection against incoming damage.

All of these abilities should be taken into account when building a character in Diablo 3. They provide a solid foundation for your character, allowing them to survive and thrive in combat before you start stacking up on DPS.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Diablo with title ""CC, LoH, and APoC before DPS (in my opinion). Baseline mechanics have to work well before it can output a ton of damage.""","Change out force armor for pinpoint barrier (+5% cc) and use the scoundrel with anatomy (+3% cc). You'll need more ApoC from a source and/or wand. You've done a good job stacking attack speed, but I feel like that has hindered you from getting more ApoC, LoH, and CC. Find a monster level that you can farm comfortably in 1.0.5 (All MLs above 0 have ilvl 63 drops) and slowly start accruing capital. Critical hit damage is a nice bonus, but only once you've collected enough APoC and LoH to set up an infinte permastun loop.

Hey everyone, 

I've been playing a lot of Diablo 3 lately and I wanted to share my thoughts on the current state of the game. 

Spectral Blades - Deep Cuts still procs CM from the bleed, Windup Wizard is still viable with some moderate gear and high crit, MP0 is super easy, MP3-4 feels like it does now, MP5+ enemy HP is to high to make it feel worth the time. 

I think the game is in a great spot overall, and it's really fun to play with friends. The only thing I would change is to make MP5 a bit more rewarding so that it feels worth the time.

What do you guys think?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Diablo with title ""Spectral Blades - Deep Cuts still procs CM from the bleed, Windup Wizard is still viable with some moderate gear and high crit, MP0 is super easy, MP3-4 feels like it does now, MP5+ enemy HP is to high to make it feel worth the time.""","Guess I'll throw my .02 in here. Spec(Spectral Blades(Deep Cuts), Twister(WW), Diamond Skin, Explosive Blast, Frost nova). Relevant Stats(DPS 37k, Crt 38%, 1.8 AS, ~42k life, ~500Resist, ~5.5k-6k Armor, 19 APoC, ~900LoH)

First off, does Spectral Blades - Deep Cuts proc CM? Yes. Tried it myself. I hit some mobs, used my Diamond skin and clearly saw it reducing my cooldown in large chunks. Was the coefficient changed at all? I dunno, it's been so long since I used Spectral Blades, but on one of those large numbered groups in A3 it seemed to proc quite often.

Act 3(MP0): Wow, they really nerfed it. This might be fun to try new specs with, as more that wouldn't be viable due to high dmg before could now be workable. Might not be the most efficient way to farm, but if you want to mix things up then why not? Enemies die very fast.

Act 3(MP3-4): Getting harder. Seems about where Inferno is now. 

Act 3(MP5): Alright, their health is now pretty high. To high for me to want to farm with my current DPS. Damage done to me is noticeably higher, and I've died from some real nasty spike damage. If you have trouble keeping stuff frozen, and you run into a nasty affix combo, you're gonna have a bad time.

Act 3 MP(10). Tried this with another wizard, and while we killed an easy affix pack, monster health is just to high to make me want to run it. Normal mobs can hit like a truck and if you lag on your windup, you're dead.

I also tried some low MP Act 1, and while I enjoy being able to get top quality loot, the enemies are to spread out for it to be efficient farming. It's nice for a change of scenery, but that's all. As for how the spec feels? Alright. Not as OP as before, but still works. I usually toss out 2 WW and then a SB hit to put up the bleeds to help reset cooldowns. I run with the cooldown reduction passive rune(can't remember name atm) and that seems to be enough. Some might want to think about taking the reduce cooldown rune for Frost Nova if your crit or attack speed is low.

TL;DR Spectral Blades - Deep Cuts still procs CM from the bleed, Windup Wizard is still viable with some moderate gear and high crit, MP0 is super easy, MP3-4 feels like it does now, MP5+ enemy HP is to high to make it feel worth the time."

As someone who has been a rider for over 20 years, I can confidently say that the Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) course is a great place to start for new riders. It provides the basic knowledge and skills necessary to safely operate a motorcycle. However, it is not the be-all-end-all of motorcycle riding.

While the MSF course is a great foundation, it is not going to magically transform anyone into a good rider. Common sense, respect for the machine, a thirst for knowledge (and research), the ability to think critically and apply that to the controls, and a host of other traits that some people just don't have are all key to surviving your motorcycle.

It takes more than just a few classes to truly master the art of riding a motorcycle. It takes dedication, practice, and a whole lot of common sense. So, if you're just starting out, take the MSF course and get a solid foundation, but don't rely too heavily on it. Do your own research, practice, and develop the skills necessary to be a safe and responsible rider.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/motorcycles with title ""The MSF, while a good base, isn't going to transform anyone into a good rider.

I didn't take one either. I *did* sit in on the BRC when my wife took it. The instructor you get when you take the MSF is pivotal in how beneficial your BRC experience will be. My wife's instructors were just a couple of good-ol'-boys earning a little extra cash on weekends. I believe many new riders put too much stock in what an MSF course instructor has to say, as though they are the end-all-be-all in motorcycling technique. The curriculum is essentially the same defensive driving techniques taught in high school drivers' ed. It's not some magic bean that keeps you from dying on the street. It's not a magic common sense pill either.

Her class was geared toward cruiser riders as well. The myths about front brake vs. rear brake were actually taught in her class. Then, as the husband, it's difficult to refute the misinformation she was given by this motorcycling god placed before her by fate.

Edit: I'd like to add that about 6 miles into her 2nd ride, she went wide in a right-hander, froze at the controls and crashed in the grass. I was behind her and had to watch and hear (Chatterboxes) the whole thing. She was uninjured but her Baby Ninja wasn't rideable. This was a week after she passed her BRC at what her instructors said was the ""top of the class.""

I was in grade 7 when I was bullied relentlessly by a group of kids. I was constantly picked on, made fun of, and even physically attacked. It got to the point where I was so fed up that I was ready to fight back. 

One day, I was walking home from school and the group of bullies was following me. I was so angry that I turned around and charged at one of them. I had him pinned against the wall and my fist was raised, ready to strike. 

Just then, a teacher walking by saw what was happening and intervened. She scolded the bullies and told me to go home. I was so relieved that I ran home and ordered a large meal from McDonald's to celebrate. 

After that day, I never had to deal with the bullies again.

My 10 month old molests a 5 year old. What should I do?

This is a very serious and concerning situation. It's important to take immediate action to ensure the safety of both children. The first thing you should do is contact a professional, such as a child psychologist, to get help in understanding the behavior and how to address it. You can also speak to your pediatrician or family doctor for advice on how to best handle the situation.

I was in 4th grade when I encountered a bully in 8th grade. He was always picking on me and my friends, and I had had enough. One day I decided to stand up to him and I beat him to bloody tears. He never bothered me or my friends again.

(i had taught them both how to defend themselves from an early age) no one EVER dared to bully either of my children for the remainder of their schoolling. 

this story was relayed to me by their bus driver ben, who happened to be a friend of mine. 

lucas, the younger, was kicked off of the bus for a week for fighting, shcool rules, although the driver clearly stated to the principal that it was a matter of self defense. ben, the driver, was quite proud of my son, no where near as proud as i was. 

i enjoyed every day of driving that boy to school.

A few weeks ago my girlfriends father (who is an ignorant idiot) started trying to blame my girlfriend for getting who drink spiked when she was out at a bar in a quite area, saying that the way she was dressed was provocative and a bunch of other disgusting and retarded reasons. He also tried to stop me coming into his house or seeing his daughter because of this, no idea how that logic worked seeing as though I was the only person comforting her.

So when I arrived at the house he started yelling at me, calling me a drug addict because he knew I have smoked weed before, yelling at me  and my girlfriend, she starts yelling back and holding in tears while I patiently waited for him to finish his shit storm idiot rant. Once finished I asked him if we were going to go inside and talk like adults about it or if he wanted to keep throwing a tantrum. He was so taken aback he told us to come in and we sat down. 

I then proceeded to go through everything he said, negating every argument and informing him how disgusting it was that he would even suggest some of the things he had said (that I was a drug addict and that the way she dressed she was asking to get her drink spiked). He continuously tried to interrupt me switching to his daughter, at which every time I calmly stated that I thought we were having an adult conversation and that I would be able to finish my story without being interrupted. By the end of my 5 minutes of knowledge bombing him he couldn't even look me in the eyes, he just said it was fine if I stayed there and I dealt with the situation in a respectful way.

I told my dad the story and he just said with a ridiculous grin on his face - ""you are definitely my son.""

Hey everyone,

I recently purchased an O2+ODAC and I'm having trouble getting it set up. I've read the manual and it says there is a USB mini connector on the rear of the unit. It says to use the supplied USB cable and connect that to my PC directly. Does this mean I don't need any other connections?

Thanks in advance for your help!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/audiophile with title ""There is a USB mini connector on the rear of your O2+ODAC - use the supplied USB cable and connect that to your PC directly.

An expensive investment :/)

Note for anyone else ordering the O2 or O2+ODAC: When you order from Epiphany Acoustics, they will supply a power supply with the correct voltage for your country.  This means that you can get away with a travel adapter instead of buying an entirely new PSU for it.

&gt; -If I used a 3.5 to 3.5 cable to connect the O2 to my ONBOARD SOUND, wouldnt I be distorting (over amplifying?) my music? Is that how onboard sound works?

If you have the O2+ODAC, there is no good reason to do this, as you will not be utilizing the ODAC, which you have paid for.  

In terms of distortion: The signal is going to be no better than the quality of your soundcard, but the O2 will provide enough power to drive difficult headphones, and may still sound massively better than the headphone jack on your PC due to driving the headphones properly.

TL;DR: There is a USB mini connector on the rear of your O2+ODAC - use the supplied USB cable and connect that to your PC directly. No other connections needed."

Hey there ELI5,

If you're downloading torrents, you should always look for the highest seeded torrents, and always seed. 

Seeding is when you upload the file you downloaded to other people who are downloading it. It helps to spread the load of downloading the file, so that it's faster for everyone.

The ""seed"" number is the number of people who are currently uploading the file. The higher the number, the faster the download will be. So when you're looking for a torrent, always look for the one with the highest seed number. 

Once you've downloaded the file, you should also seed it, so that other people can download it faster. It's a good idea to leave the file seeding for a few days, so that people can get the file quickly.

Thanks for asking!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/explainlikeimfive with title ""Always look for the highest seeded torrents, and always seed.""","Think of it like mailing pages of a book to different people who own photocopiers. If you have the full set, A, B and C, and then you give three people one of those pages after you've photocopied them, there are now 2 people out of 4 who have A, B or C. Then, everyone photocopies what they have and redistributes it, Which means that you don't have to send out 3 copies of the same file, only 2, and the others contribute one.

Same works with torrenting; the more people there are that have a piece of the file, the easier it is to get hold of, and the less each person has to contribute. As soon as someone has a piece, their connection uploads it to torrent programs that want it, and in return they can get pieces from other people. Essentially, the more people involved, the faster the file spreads, because everyone can start copying and sending off the parts they already have.

TL;DR -Always look for the highest seeded torrents, and always seed."

Hey everyone! 

I'm sure you've all heard of the ""cookie cutter combo"" for your build in Diablo III. I'm sure you've also heard of the debate about whether or not it's the best way to go. Well, I'm here to tell you that there is a reason why the cookie cutter combo is the cookie cutter combo. 

First off, it's the most efficient use of your stat points. With the cookie cutter combo, you can get the most out of your stats without having to invest too much in any one stat. This allows you to focus on getting the best gear and skills for your build, without having to worry about allocating too much or too little in any one stat. 

Second, it's the most effective way to get the job done. You can be sure that when you use the cookie cutter combo, you're getting the most out of your build. This means that you can be sure that you're maximizing your damage output or survivability, or whatever it is you're trying to achieve. 

Finally, it's the most reliable way to get the job done. You know that if you use the cookie cutter combo, you'll get the results you want. That's why it's called the cookie cutter combo, because it's reliable and consistent. 

So if you're looking for the best way to build your character in Diablo III, look no further than the cookie cutter combo. It's the most efficient, effective, and reliable way to get the job done. 

Also, ADD ME dont forget.. Im not kidding about the items. I'm always looking for new people to play with and I'd love to help you get the best gear for your build. So don't hesitate to add me and let's get playing!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Diablo with title ""There is a reason why the cookie cutter combo is the cookie cutter combo.

Have you ever wanted to experience something that you can't explain? Something that is beyond your own consciousness? DMT is a drug unlike any other that can bring you to a place that you have never been before.

I believe that everyone who is considering trying DMT should do so correctly and safely. When taken correctly, it usually lasts from 5-15 minutes, and I typically sprinkle it on a bowl of weed and hold a lighter far enough away to vaporize/slightly combust the bud.

Compared to other psychedelics, DMT is a far different experience. If salvia is a freakish nightmare, DMT is a beautiful and lucid dream. It can bring you to a place of understanding, creativity, and peace.

If you are considering trying DMT, please do so safely and responsibly. Be sure to research the drug properly, and be aware of the potential risks and side effects.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""DMT is a drug unlike any other that can bring you outside of your own consciousness.

Of course there are a variety of ways to smoke or vaporize it, but a key rule is keeping it in your lungs once you've inhaled it. Without this step you probably won't break through.

There have been so many tales of extraordinary experiences on this drug, and I'm here to say that every time I've broken through has been a profound and memorable experience. Many people report seeing humanoid figures or other conscious beings (aliens?) reaching out to them. I can't say that this has been consistently true for me, but in the 10-15 time's I've tried it, I've broken through to have ""out-of-body"" experiences maybe 8 times. I've witnessed wholly hallucinated experiences from giant flowers made of soft peach-colored flesh bouncing to Animal Collective, to flying through a stone cavern at blinding speed on color-changing rapids to Battles. All with my eyes closed.

What I can say is that it is unlike every other drug. You may reach an out-of-body experience that allows you to hallucinate things you ordinarily would not on other psychedelics like shrooms and LSD. The most prominent adjective I would use to describe a true DMT experience would be dream-like and meditative, not nightmarish or frightening. I have never had or seen anyone have a bad time on DMT.

""So last night I was hanging out with some friends and we decided to play a game of twister. We were all pretty drunk and decided to take it to the next level and play naked.

I still can't believe we did it!""","give me the text of a reddit post from r/WTF with title ""Naked game of twister with friends.""","This reminds me of this gal I met in Atlanta, Georgia. She was cute with emerald eyes, and seemed to be very into me. I decided I would do well with my A-game deployed. All I had to do was be quiet, nod from time to time, and smile occasionally.

I know myself very well; when I start talking, the vaginas within earshot tend to dry out like smeared boogers under a computer chair. My methods may seem out of the ordinary, but I have learned to trust and depend on my looks. My soul is ugly, but she won't notice as long as I keep a lid on it.

The night goes well and she is all over my arm. I am still quiet and sometimes I have to deftly tuck my dong under my belt to avoid being mistaken as some jerk. We decide her place is where we'll go and off we went. This night my luck would change!

We get to her apartment and it smells like testicles after basketball practice. No big deal, at least she had a tidy place. We lay on the couch after putting any movie into the DVD player. Started kissing, and other stuff adults are notorious for.

As I am getting some neck, her iguana climbs slowly on to my back. (She lets it roam free; this explains the odor.) ""Oh look! It's Q-Ball!"" She says cheerfully. She grabs him off of my back and his claws scratch me all to hell. ""Uhh. Hello there, Q-Ball..."" I said concealing my irritation. We stop making out and she delivers a lengthy introduction to the huge lizard. I'm pretty sure Q-Ball knows my name, favorite color, and birthday at this point.

""Wanna feed him!?"" she asked enthusiastically. ""Yeah, that'd be cool!"" I replied as genuinely as I could. No one appreciates being cock-blocked by a reptile. It's not like I felt inadequate, I know damn well I can please a woman better than some scaly tree crawler. We fed Q-Ball chunks of squash and that's when she dropped the bomb on me.

""He really likes you. But we can't do anything tonight. Q-Ball has been with me a long time and he's got my six. We should wait and get to know each other better first. I'm sure you understand."" she said. I just shrugged and pecked her on the cheek. ""Of course I understand. I'm glad you have a friend in Q-Ball."" I said rather convincingly.

We've been dating for a few months now and just last night I finally got to seal the deal with her. She was amazing in bed! But she insisted Q-Ball had to watch us because she couldn't get aroused unless she knew she was safe. If that girl ever cheats on me, it will be with Q-Ball, I just know it. Whenever you buy large amounts of meat, it helps to put meal sized portions into the freezer. I use ziploc bags, but you can use tupperware and wax paper too.

This is a great question and the answer depends on what type of workload you are dealing with. If you are running a GPGPU-like (homogeneous) workload with a low clock rate, then it is possible to get good performance. However, if you are running a workload with a higher clock rate, then BS is likely the best option. The key is to find the optimal balance between performance and power efficiency.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/linux with title ""This is possible on GPGPU-like (homogeneous) workloads with a low clock rate. Otherwise, BS.""","What applications? Are you talking SIMT or SIMD? I have considerable experience with coding *real* world applications (in customer's hands) for many-core (single die) architectures at this scale and [much] larger. I also write compilers for them. Could you give us an estimate of your current fetch/ALU ratio?

For those who don't know about these devices, let me put it into GPU terms (SIMT only; SIMD is much, much harder to analyze): fetch would correspond to a texture sample, ALU is the work done on the sample. If the arch's fetch/ALU ratio is 1:4, then you need 4 (pure, non loading) arithmetic operations per memory request to keep the part ""fed"". A ratio as low as 1:4 is only really possible with low clock rate/memory rate ratio, and (nearly pure) SIMT. For instance, a large RT pixel shader on a Radeon 5870 would have numbers like this.

SIMT means ""single instruction multiple thread"" and refers to totally non-communicating processes. SIMD means ""single instruction multiple data"", where each lane is allowed to communicate. For instance, the SSE instruction HADD is SIMD, not SIMT, because the lanes of the vector unit ""talk"". Likewise, gather is SIMT, whereas permute is SIMD.

For many core (single die) devices, another problem is that the workload has to be fairly homogenous across all the ALU [vector] units, or you will starve the units when they thrash the local working set of hot data. This means that for SIMT architectures, it is not just enough to have homogeneous per ALU [vector] work, but also homogeneous workload across the entire device.

This is entirely different from, say, the large scale server x86 boxes. These devices are truly high-throughput serial devices, designed to allow an enormous amount of thrash on the local working set. They do this with high frequency rates, OOO pipes, and staged caches of every (ginormous) sizes, and narrow vector units.

**tl;dr** This is possible on GPGPU-like (homogeneous) workloads with a low clock rate. Otherwise, BS."

It's true that the world's GDP is not a zero-sum game, and this is a great time to be poor and in despair. But it's also important to understand how money works, as it can help the poor and those in despair to make the most of their situation. Money is not a finite resource, and it's not something that can be taken away from one person and given to another. Instead, money can be used to create more opportunities and help people build better lives. With the right financial education and access to resources, anyone can make the most of their situation, no matter how poor they may be.

It's the same reason that people can invest in the stock market long term and ALWAYS expect growth (over years, possibly decades). The economy grows.

An easy example is the homeless. Even now, at the local shelter I work at, every homeless person has had some fast food within the week and has access to a cellular phone. Either their own or their family's. The poor of today have it incredibly better than the poor of a hundred years ago. Look at all the leisure time we have now in the middle class and lower class. I have a family friend who farmed back in the day. He had maybe 2-3 hours a day, from age 12 to 30, of ""free"" time. Nowadays his kids, in the same farm, have 4+ hours/day, including school.

Most American kids have some access to education. Some social welfare program. Something. Compare that with a century ago. 150 years ago in the start of the Industrial Age people had a life expectancy of less than 40 years because of the lack of regulation and laws. Things are improving. The economy is NOT a zero-sum game. Ever heard of the rule of 72? Yeah, your real wealth as a country doubles once every generation or so (at least in developing countries). Where do you get these figures you're saying? What is the majority of the world? How are they in despair? I was perfectly happy being poor when I was younger in a developing country. I'm just as happy, maybe less, once I became (relatively) successful. Also, I don't know what gas tanks you're talking about. I think the highest end sport-yacht is the Cigarette, costing a little under a million. I sincerely doubt they spend as much to top off the gas tank as the yacht costs.

Believe it or not, this is not a bad time to be poor at all. Google it if you don't believe me. Lots of sources say that this century is the most peaceful, just to give another comparison. Least violent century in recorded history (not by volume, but by percentage)

I'm sure we've all had those games where we just can't seem to win, no matter what we do. I know it can be really frustrating, but I just wanted to remind everyone to take a step back and not to get too worked up about it.

Instead of sitting there and complaining about how bad your team is or how the enemy is playing better than you, take a look at your own play. Ask yourself what you could have done differently, or what kind of decisions you could have made to turn the game around.

It's easy to get caught up in the moment and just blame your teammates or the enemy team, but it's important to remember that it's not always their fault. A lot of times, it's your own play that can make or break a game, so don't forget to take a look at yourself and figure out the difference between a good axe and a bad one. Don't chase bad axes, take a step back and figure out what you could have done better.

My father and I have always had a special bond, especially when it comes to cars. We had a truck that we worked on together for years. We put countless hours and sweat into it, and it was a labor of love for us both.

Unfortunately, one day, the truck caught fire and we had to part with it. I was devastated, but we moved on.

Recently, I decided to rebuild the truck from the ground up. I was surprised to find pieces of a piston in the oil and pan. I knew it was from the original truck, and I couldn't help but smile. I knew that I had to rebuild it, in part, due to the fond memories I had with my father.

Luckily we were at a rest stop and a couple truckers had extinguishers. But it was too late much of the truck had been burned. Come to find out a fuel line had broken. Well it was the only truck we had at the time that could pull and money was tight so we replaced the interior and got her running right and continued to use it.

This is going to come as a bit of a shock to you because his perspectives can seem quite extreme particularly to someone who is used to putting human rights ahead of all other animal rights.

Nevertheless, Peter Singer's approach is one of utilitarianism. The idea is that veganism is concerned with doing the least amount of harm possible. As another poster pointed out, there is no necessary opposition between the life of an animal and the life of a human, insofar as a human can eat vegetarian foods now'a'days and leave the animal alone completely. In this instance, you can minimize the harm done to an animal (by not killing it, subjecting it to cruelty, etc) without increasing the harm done to you in any material way (I mean, so what if you don't eat meat).

Vegans therefore avoid animal products to minimize harm. Follow me so far? You could argue that if a chicken lives a plush and happy life, a vegan should be okay with eating eggs the chicken produces. In some cases, they ARE okay with this - I have known vegans who may selectively eat eggs if they know the farm and know the chickens were well cared for and not subjected to any harm. But this isn't about veganism, this is about abortion rights.

So I can see how you could turn this back on me: how is terminating a pregnancy minimizing harm? Well this is a complicated question. For starters, consider the exemption sane pro-lifers give in instances of rape or incest. The idea here is that carrying the baby to term will be so cruel to the woman, so emotionally painful, that terminating the pregnancy is a logically acceptable answer. The woman may not be ready for parenthood, and the infant could have a difficult life because the mother lacks resources necessary to properly care for a child. Carrying the child to term could be just as cruel to the child as to the mother, as the child may not enjoy the loving support it needs to live a fulfilling life. Everyone suffers.

Likewise, if the mother's life is at risk (such as ectopic pregnancy) - the woman could go on to bear HEALTHY children later in life that won't kill her. Forcing her to have a child that is guaranteed to terminate her life is not minimizing harm.

The question is where to draw the line, then. Pro-choice advocates don't think that women should go out having abortions left and right. Nobody enjoys having abortions - it can be a difficult experience. But if a mother believes that having the child will be a net negative for herself and for the child - if the child is virtually guaranteed to have a difficult life because of the mother's current situation, or because it could harm the mother, because the mother did not intend to have a child and it would ruin her life to take care of the child - these might be valid reasons that having an abortion minimizes harm. 

Saying that abortion should be illegal under all circumstances (or only in an extremely limited subset) denies women the ability to minimize harm in some circumstances. The idea here is that state shouldn't be able to decide what is best for a woman's life, as the woman is the only one in a good position to make that call.

Obviously, the preferred solution is to make access to birth control easy, to keep the public WELL EDUCATED (none of this ""abstinence is the only 100% effective method"" bullshit), and you will reduce abortions a HUGE amount.

Anyway, if your ethical viewpoint is that all human life is absolutely to be protected under all circumstances, you may reach situations where your requirement of protecting human life makes people suffer greatly. Consider end-of-life care for terminal cancer patients. If the patient is in immense physical pain with no hope of recovery, would you require that they attempt to stay alive as long as possible, or would you be all right with them dying on their own terms? I'm not saying this is analogous to pregnancy, I'm just saying that there are some circumstances where an ethos that requires you to protect human life is NOT the same as protecting the QUALITY of human life. In some circumstances, a conflict might arise where the latter becomes just as important as the former, and the pro-choice argument is that the state shouldn't have a hand in deciding for someone individually.

**TL;DR: Both may be attempts to minimize suffering. Protecting a life is not the same as protecting the QUALITY of a life.**"

I'm sure many of you have heard of [COMC], and there are some who think it should be banned or at least set aside a day to not play it. I personally don't agree with this sentiment and see no reason to ban it or set aside a day for it.

I think [COMC] is a great game that can be enjoyed by all ages. It's simple enough for younger players to understand, yet has enough strategy to keep adults entertained. I think it's a great game to introduce to new players, as it's easy to learn and can be a great way to teach more complex games.

I understand why some may think it should be banned or set aside a day for it, but I don't think it's necessary. If someone doesn't like it, then they can simply choose not to play it. There's no need to ban it or set aside a day for it.

I'm so tired of people blaming parents who regret having children for not realizing they'd be miserable. The truth is that society has been telling us for years that having kids is the only way to be truly fulfilled. We're constantly bombarded with messages that having children is essential to happiness and success in life. 

It's not the parents' fault that they felt like they had to have children to be happy. It's the culture's fault for perpetuating this idea and not being honest about the reality of parenting. We need to stop shaming parents who don't want to have kids and start having honest conversations about the difficulties and rewards of parenting.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/childfree with title ""Don't blame miserable parents for not realizing they'd be miserable, blame the culture that told them they wouldn't be.""","Great image, but I'm not 100% certain I agree.

But often the facts of the matter are that when you grow up in an environment full of certain messages, you're likely to end up believing those as true (Go to college if you want a life, have kids, get a 9-5 job and be responsible, etc). It's not at all fair to blame people for listening to the things they have been told *their entire lives,* just because you had the insight to realize it's bullshit and escape from it.

Rather, we need to start challenging the messages. We don't get anything other than a smug sense of superiority by blaming people and saying ""Oh? You're miserable because you had kids? Well, that's what you get for just buying into the kids = happy crap."" We instead need to encourage people to think their decisions through like we (presumably) have done, so that they can come to their own conclusions about what is best for them, rather than what society says is best for them.

3D printing has been gaining traction in recent years, and it's no surprise that it's being seen as a potential way to revolutionize manufacturing. But while 3D printing has been touted as a potential way to revolutionize mass production, the reality is that it's more likely to become profitable in niche areas before it takes on mass production. 

For example, 3D printing offers a lot of potential for prototyping and custom manufacturing, as it allows for rapid production of complex parts and products. This means that companies can quickly create custom products and parts, without having to invest in expensive tooling. This makes it ideal for companies that need to produce small batches of unique products, or for companies that need to quickly create prototypes for testing. 

In addition, 3D printing can also be used to produce parts and products that are difficult to produce with traditional manufacturing methods. This means that companies can produce complex parts and products that would be impossible to produce with traditional manufacturing methods. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for companies that need to produce complex parts or products.

Ultimately, it's likely that 3D printing will become profitable in niche areas before it takes on mass production. This means that companies should focus on finding ways to use 3D printing to their advantage, whether it be for prototyping, custom manufacturing, or complex parts and products.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/business with title ""3D printing will become profitable in niche areas before it takes on mass production.""","It isn't a matter of mechanics, not really.  You're thinking of it from an engineering viewpoint, when you should be thinking of it from a business standpoint.  

Granted injection molding isn't going to just disappear, but for applications where the costs involved are cheaper to 3D print on location, rather than wait for delivery and pay transportation (think big construction products) - yes, for those applications 3d printing is going to be absolutely necessary.

I work in shipping (so slightly different than your IM example but bear with me), and i'd gladly pay $500k to have a machine that could print a critical part on demand in steel.  That may not be even 5 years away!

I've had to have ships wait on demurrage of $30k a day, for 7 or 8 days at a time waiting for a fucking man hatch cover to be finished, shipped and installed on site so that the USCG will clear the vessel as seaworthy.  Essentially, that hatch cover cost me $200k.  

If I could make one on site, the difference in price between the regular making of one, and mass production argument you are making doesn't matter.  I'd be a fool not to pick a 3D printed version every time.  Even if it's 30x more expensive than a mass produced unit on a unit cost basis.

TL;DR

3D printing will become profitable in niche areas before it takes on mass production. "

""Did mushrooms that were too magical ever exist? I'm talking about the kind of mushrooms that could make you fly or give you superpowers. Have any of these ever been documented?""","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""Did mushrooms that were too magical""","this is going to take a long time to type....
this summer me and my best friend did some mushrooms, but these mushrooms were no ordinary mushrooms. 
It's was a mid summer night, and we were bored as usual, so being the type of kids we are we started looking for acid, Which is never an easy find. After three hours nothing had turned up, and we had basically lost hope on the night. Thirty more minutes rolled around and we had long since called it quits, when my other friend said he could get boomers. ""hells yeah!"" I was thinking.... early assumption. My friend comes down to my house and we pile in my car to go get them, only about a twenty minute drive, and we would be getting them from a house so it wasn't at all sketchy. We arrive, and my friend goes in to get them, my best friend and I chat in the car for about five minutes until the other friend comes back. He gets in the car and says, ""you guys are in for a wild night, these are from her personal stash, and they're not psilocybin meniscus."" To me and my best friend, this was awesome, something we had never tried, something new. 

Anyway we get back to my house and prepare to eat the boomers, we have a Quarter of an ounce to split, of which there was one massive stem and about eight caps. I took the stem and my best friend had the caps. I forgot to mention that these shrooms were super weird looking (for magic mushrooms) and had this weird white powder on the outside. Anyway we scarf them down, and after about eight minutes I was FUCKED up. usually shrooms take about an hour to kick in so this made me a little nervous, but I figured oh well more time to trip. we decide to go on a walk and for the whole journey everything looked like it was in pixels, and the moon looked like the sun in minecraft. we walk back to my house and go down into my basement, throw on adult swim, and converse like we always do on mushrooms. this goes on for about two hours, and is a super good time until my best friend needed to take out his contacts. Now he is really blind, so I can no longer explain what he may be seeing, but I can tell you what I saw. After getting his contacts out, he gets really quiet. This makes me sort of uncomfortable, but I'm on shrooms, so i just rationalize it to the boomers. My belly started to feel upset so I turn to my friend and say, ""want to go smoke a bowl?"" to help me calm it down. He looks at me as if I were satan himself and yells, ""NO!!!"" So being somewhat annoyed at this i went to smoke a cigarette, Finish that up and go back downstairs. I had one of those Arizona dollar fruit punches and I took a drink of it. My friend says in a really sweet voice, ""hey man can I see that?"" I say , ""sure man"" and hand it to him. He takes the can, gives it that same look he gave me, and throws it at my fireplace. Mind you I am tripping harder then I had in a long time, to me time was unfathomable, everything was making intense patterns, so I could do nothing about this but yell, ""WHAT THE FUCK MAN?!"" he just looked at me an stood up, moving towards the stairs. This freaked me out because my parents were sleeping and I did not want to wake them up being on shrooms. So I grabbed my smokes and followed him. He walks up the stairs to the main level in my house and makes a break for the upstairs, at which point I grabbed him, because I did not want him up there. But he pulled away and got upstairs, and into my room. I follow him, but am intercepted by What I saw as a Dementor wearing a pink bathrobe, but was actually my mother. The hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life was give her a hug, because to me she was trying to suck my soul out. she walks downstairs, but to me she is floating, meanwhile my friend is derping around my room. But he sees me and instantly goes straight down the stairs and has a breakdown in front of the door, I push him outside and am walking out myself when my mother says, ""what's wrong?"" to which I respond a sharp, ""NOTHING."" I close the door and my friend pulls out his pack, grabs a smoke from it, and throws both of them on the ground. he then looks up at me and asks in a snape-like tone, ""can you give me a cigarette?"" So I grab  the one he dropped, put it in his mouth and light it. He proceeds to eat the cigarette, getting the whole filter in his mouth before I can pull it out. At this point, I can't take it anymore, I take him inside, get him a blanket and a pillow, say goodnight and go to my room. i spend the next five hours listening to music and watching my posters move. 

The next morning he Txts me asking what had happened the night before, long conversation ensued.

Scams and exploits are a part of the gaming landscape, and while they should not be encouraged, it is important that developers like Blizzard take steps to ensure that these activities are not aided by outside software. The best way to do this is to make certain actions impossible within the game, rather than relying on an external team of BanMasters to police the population. This is exactly what Blizzard is doing, and (to my knowledge) what they've always done, and is the best way to ensure that the game remains fair and enjoyable for all players.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Diablo with title ""Scams and exploits are legitimate game mechanics when not aided by outside software.  If developers like Blizzard don't want players performing certain actions in their games, the action should be made impossible within the software rather than unleashing the hordes of oppressive BanMasters into the population.  This is exactly what Blizzard is doing, and (to my knowledge) what they've always done, and is what's best for the game.""","You're 100% correct.  To add to this, I'd like to point out that policing cheating via third party software is pretty much the ONLY thing that Blizzard (or any other online game developer) should police.  The only exceptions I think would involve harassment (as in spam or real life threats) and other instances in which another player's actions are completely unavoidable to his/her victim.

When developers step in to enforce ""fair play"" on players who are completely staying within the confines of the software that the developers themselves put out, you end up with a lot of discrepancies and unjust bans.  It's happened countless times, and I'm sure most of you have heard of similar situations where somebody found a quick way to get ahead of other players via legitimate, in-game means, and got banned for it.  It's happened on Xbox live, in Guild Wars, and EA is pretty notorious for this as well. If Blizzard adopted similar policies, we'd see people banned for clearing inferno with force armor abuse (release patch), stacking attack speed pre-nerf, using the currently ""OP"" trail of cinders rune, or farming with a WW barb.  These are all instances that many people have considered to be unfair advantage exploits, but it's detrimental to the game as a whole to ban players for such innovation.

Some of you are probably saying ""well those exploits didn't directly effect other players."" Sure, it's definitely not nice to scam people, but there could be so many things that people would consider to be a scam.  If they banned people for trade window scamming, who's to say they shouldn't ban people for things like equipping weak gold find gear in team games, or doing the max bid ""exploit"" that everyone was talking about a few weeks ago.  Both of these come at other players' expense, but none of them violate the terms of service. They are unforeseen, specific situations that inevitably arise in any online game and would be impossible to write them all into the EULA.  If they were to suddenly ban people for rules that were never outlined, it becomes yet another PR nightmare for them, as well as a (I think) very unethical policy.

If Blizzard doesn't want people performing certain actions within the legitimate confines of their software, then they need to take it out on themselves, not the players.  By this I mean FIX IT ON THE SOFTWARE END so that players are unable to do this in the first place.  Granted, trade window scams are usually avoidable user error, but I also think they could be made safer to use, like they were for the most part in WoW. (Maybe they are by now, I haven't actually used one in awhile).  Blizzard is usually pretty good about fixing stuff like this, and I think their philosophy is similar to mine in that scams and exploits should be made impossible (if at all possible) before account bans should even be considered.  

Lastly, in the case of a possible ""macro"" like OP's situation, whether or not using a macro that allows you to switch an item out of the trade window quickly is an offense worth banning someone for is somewhat debatable.  While it is a third party program, it's impact on the game is minimal and avoidable (as seen in the OP's video).  It's also difficult to prove because some people might just be able to swap items quickly through practice.  OP's video did seem impossibly fast to me, but how would Blizzard be able to fairly gauge how fast is too fast for trade window swapping?  Besides, it still kind of goes along with what I've been saying about how player actions shouldn't be banned.  Macros are designed to simulate an action that a player can do anyway, just faster.  This type of situation can be completely avoided in the future if Blizzard fixes the trade window to lock up for several seconds after any type of item swap is detected.

If OP is reading this far, I think your case would have been better accepted had you argued his offense was the use of a third party macro program, not the scam attempt itself.  Although I will admit that one Blizzard representative made it quite obvious that they either didn't read your email, or were only allowed to copy+paste a pre-written response.  The final response you received seemed more personable and I wouldn't be surprised if it had come from a manager of some sort.  It was still somewhat cryptic, but I'm not so sure your message was entirely clear to them, either.

TL;DR: Scams and exploits are legitimate game mechanics when not aided by outside software.  If developers like Blizzard don't want players performing certain actions in their games, the action should be made impossible within the software rather than unleashing the hordes of oppressive BanMasters into the population.  This is exactly what Blizzard is doing, and (to my knowledge) what they've always done, and is what's best for the game."

Hey everyone, 

I think it's time to discuss the cooldown and warp time in StarCraft. Currently, the cooldown is at 4 seconds and the warp time is at 4 seconds. I think it's time to bump the warp time up to 10 seconds and keep the cooldown as it is. 

The change in warp time would help make the game more strategic and give players more time to think and plan out their strategy. This would also help level the playing field for newer players as they wouldn't be as rushed to make decisions. 

What do you guys think? Should we keep the cooldown as it is and bump the warp time up to 10 seconds?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/starcraft with title ""Keep cooldown as it is, bump warp time from 4 to 10 seconds.""","Maybe this is just a silly idea of mine, but what if actual warp time is increased?

Unfalsifiable is not a synonym for dismiss-able, it's a synonym for ""not science"".

Today I learned that if you're flying, you should always sit behind the wings of the plane in order to increase your chances of survival should the plane crash. This is because most airplane crashes happen within the first and last five minutes of the flight.

The reason for this, is that aircraft have a tendency to break at the wing and tail, when they crash. 

If you are sitting behind the wings, and the craft crashes, it gives you multiple options to egress the plane.  You will have the fracture in the front, rear, and most likely an emergency door will still be intact.


TL;DR  Always sit behind the wings, to survive.

Hey everyone,

I recently started talking to a girl I like and I'm trying to figure out the best way to approach her. I saw a few posts on here about ignoring her, flirting back if she initiates, and reading up on sex, but I'm not sure what the best course of action is.

It's funny how people will take a single piece of information, twist it around, and then use it to try and prove a point. It's the classic straw man argument. We've all seen it before; someone takes a point of view, then creates a caricature of that point of view and then proceeds to attack the caricature rather than the actual point of view. It's a logical fallacy and it's not a very effective way to prove your point. If you want to make a convincing argument, make sure you're attacking the actual point of view and not a straw man.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/atheism with title ""You wanted to use this information to prove a point, but it's not very useful in backing up your point. As I said way back, straw man.""","And yet that anonymity isn't always enough for people to say, out loud, that they are atheists. If it was a phone survey, they have your phone number. And if they have your phone number...well, put it together yourself. When there are fundamentalists out there that believe atheists should be registered like sex offenders, a lie can many times allay the fears  of being ""found out"" and ostracized or confronted or discriminated against.

Also, while I sort of understand your Buddhist conversions argument, another problem with the survey is that it's not asking about beliefs, but about religions. People have a desire to be a part of something bigger than the individual and will reach out to religion many times to fill that void. It doesn't mean that atheists suddenly believe in a god, it means they want something more than what they have had. Sometimes it's pantheism, paganism, deism, atheistic Buddhism, etc. 

I once embraced Buddhism as a ""way of life"" and rejected the notion that it was a religion. During that time, I still believed in a higher power and eventually went back to Christianity before shedding all supernatural beliefs and openly stating my atheism (to myself and close friends only due to fear of rejection from my family). If I went back to Buddhism now, as an atheist, I still wouldn't believe in a god or higher power and yet may chose to label myself as a Buddhist. That doesn't mean that I'm not also an atheist. And **this** is why the survey is flawed. It simply asks what were you raised and what do you consider yourself now and if there is a change, it's set as a hit against the initial group.

Where's Universal Unitarian? Pagan? Secular humanism? Any other association with belief and not religion? Remember, people like labels. It helps them file things away in their mind and shorten the amount of time necessary to form opinions. 

TLDR: You wanted to use this information to prove a point, but it's not very useful in backing up your point. As I said way back, straw man."

It's easy to get caught up in the grind of daily Guild Wars 2 activities and forget the importance of using your skills to cycle through your atunements. But don't forget that using your skills can save you a lot of time and frustration.

Whether you are farming for gold, crafting materials, or just trying to level up your character, cycling through your atunements can be a great way to maximize your efficiency. It's a simple concept but it can make a big difference. 

By cycling through your atunements, you can quickly switch between different activities without having to stop and switch gear or wait for cooldowns. This can save you a lot of time and help you get more out of your play session.

Welcome to r/Guildwars2!

In this post, I wanted to talk about having an identity and philosophy in the game. It's easy to get caught up in the grind of the game, and forget why we're playing in the first place. Having a personal identity and philosophy can help keep you focused and motivated.

Your identity can be anything from a specific class or build, to a particular playstyle, to a specific goal you're working towards. It can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be.

Your philosophy is an attitude you take towards the game. It can be anything from a ""play to win"" mentality, to a more relaxed and casual approach. Having a philosophy will help you stay focused on why you're playing, and what you're trying to accomplish.

So, take some time to think about what kind of identity and philosophy you want to have in Guild Wars 2. Once you have it, stick to it and make it part of your gaming experience.

Good luck, and have fun!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Guildwars2 with title ""Get an identity/philosophy and hold it""","14 years experience here. It's not about what you do, it is how you do it. Many guilds base themselves on what they do instead of how they do it.

Example: You want to do PvP. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of guilds out there that do PvP. That is -what- you do. 
Now -how- do you do it? Figure that out and keep it as your guild signature. If the -how- is that you train your members, teach them, have set trainers, accept complete newbies and show them the ropes using training sessions. Then that is how you do it, how you get the team together, how you keep the team ready for battle etc. 

Some people will like this and join up with you and stay with you because of that. Others will not like this and leave and join someone else.

Those might join, for example, a guild where there is no training, no newbies are accepted and everyone plays at around the same level and the leader curses and yells at the members when they do something wrong, calling it tough love. Some members will leave because of this and join the first guild, others will like the bootcamp style ordering around stay in this guild. Both are pvp guilds.

Another example for the pvp guild would be the seemingly random BYOB guild that focuses heavily on activity. Something is -always- happening. The BYOB nature of the guild means new techniques may be discovered but it also means it will lose a lot of matches because.. BYOB. (Bring Your Own Build)

Another (probably better) explanation of what I mean with ""how"" is.. How do you handle internal conflicts? They -will- happen. 
My guild, The Order of the Black Lion investigates conflicts by taking everyone separate. We have a set procedure for that. Other guilds put all parties together and work it out by talking. We separate and work it out based on facts we get. We then do psychological mumbojumbo and fix stuff. 
Some guilds trust the older member over the newer member or trust higher ranked officers over lower ranked members. That works too. Not sure if it works well, but it works. I'm biased towards keeping everyone same level. Oh and regarding officers...

This too is all about the -how- and the personality and signature of your guild. How do you pick officers? What are your officers for? Some guilds give officer positions to the first 10 members who join. I've never joined or had any dealing with those types of guilds so I don't know how effective that is (ahem). Other guilds have the officers be personal friends of the guild leader. It makes sense for the leader to make his friends officers because he knows them and can ""trust"" them. But not everyone who is a friend is a good officer. 
In my guild, officer positions are temporary job-like positions given to people who do the thing we expect the officer to do anyway or are capable of doing it. 
Some guilds have their officers be long time members or members who are good at what they do etc.

Another thing: the leader. What you do is PvP. How you manage stuff, how you do things is what defines what the guild is like. Change the leader to someone else and the guild changes fundamentally. The leader is the foundation. You set the identity, you set what the guild does.

Members will come and go but the ones who identify with your guild are the ones who will stay, the ones who don't, will leave. And that is ok. 

Because of this, you are the guardian, the one who safeguards the guild, the one who leads its progression. Basically the one who leads. Obviously. 
If the guild changes into a direction your core member don't identify with or don't feel part of, you lose those members. You will get new ones but it won't be the same. What I mean is that when you set the identity, you also have to keep it, uphold it, etc. That's stability. 

**TL;DR**: Get an identity/philosophy and hold it"

In recent years, the fish farming industry has seen a huge growth in popularity due to its potential to provide a sustainable source of protein. However, despite this, the industry remains relatively small scale compared to other animal farming operations.

This is due to a variety of factors, such as the need for specialized equipment and expertise to set up and maintain a fish farm, as well as the fact that fish farming requires a large amount of space and resources to be successful. Additionally, the cost of the fish feed and other inputs needed to run a successful fish farm can be prohibitively expensive.

Overall, the fish farming industry is still in its infancy and there is potential for it to grow and become more widespread in the future. However, there are still many challenges to overcome before this can happen.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/science with title ""why are the fishfarm industry so small scale?""","i was thinking about exactly this just yesterday and my thought was,
how is it even possible that we are out-fishing the seas? i'm not doubting it's happening just that there is enough food for everyone (if evenly distributed) and we are not over-harvesting our crops or over-slaughtering our cattle. there might be cases of over-hunting but that is usually not for food. why is there so few fish-farms? 70% of earth is water, and no one lives there! super much room for farms. of course there is some engineering and ecologic difficulties but really, we went to the moon 50 years ago! today we have robots that can learn and are able to see peoples thoughts, we built a 828 meter high tower. surely we should be able to build fishfarms. this should have been happening long ago, i feel traditions and conservationism is to blame here.

This is a discussion about the recent surge in demand for marijuana in the United States, as well as the implications it has for different social groups. 

It's no secret that the marijuana industry is booming in the US. However, what's often overlooked is the fact that the demand for marijuana is not limited to the stereotypical young and rebellious demographic. In fact, the most recent data suggests that middle aged white dudes are increasingly turning to marijuana to relax after a long day at work. 

This trend has some interesting implications. For one, it helps keep the suburbs looking like suburbs, as the demand for marijuana is no longer limited to the ""ghetto"", where it is still easy to score a dime bag. This means that the demand for marijuana is more spread out, and no longer concentrated in certain areas. 

At the same time, it also means that these middle aged white dudes are more likely to stockpile marijuana, as they no longer have to worry about running out. This could lead to an increase in prices, as well as a rise in the number of people who are using marijuana. 

Ultimately, this trend is a positive development for the marijuana industry, as it shows that the demand for marijuana is no longer limited to one demographic. Whether or not this trend will continue remains to be seen, but it's clear that the marijuana industry is here to stay.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/worldnews with title ""middle aged white dudes who aren't sketching around in back alleys but blaze like a motherfucker when they come back from the office are gonna be prone to stockpile.  And that helps keep the suburbs lookin like suburbs, and the ghetto still and always the place to score a dime bag...""","On the face of it, yeah, 700 grams is a lot.  But I don't think it's necessarily as bad as you might think.  In fact, if you're offended by drug related crime, you should probably be in favor of casual users stock piling around that much...

See, if you smoke on the regular, that much weed is still going to run out.  You're not going to use 700 grams all at once, so that volume has to be judged by consumption rate and accessibility of resupply.  That resin  might be his absolute primo stash that he dips into on rare occasion, and if he can only resupply every 3 years....  Basically, for some smokers (all day, erry day, amiright?), 700 grams can be 'just enough' and then they are totally satisfied in terms of drug transactions for a long while.

Which brings me back to crime: since we can't keep even drugs out of super max prisons, let's work under the assumption that people are still going to be able to score on occasion.  Do we want lots of drug transactions with lots of hard to prosecute interactions, easy cash flow, and low costs of entry to the market combined with high investigatory costs?  Or do we want an industry that requires deep pockets to play around in (providing legal surface area and related assets), is continually dealing in significant volumes (minimizing the number of players), and with a minimum number of targets to legislate, investigate, and regulate all while having a more predictable supply to minimize market opportunity to new entrants?

Smokers going out and scoring here and there keeps the drug war broad and wide, and punishes responsible users who get hit with disproportionate penalties for living their lives in a more law abiding manner.  And the only upside is more drug dealers who exist in an easier, more profitable, market.   Home or regional growers supplying large volumes of nationally grown weed to residential users for personal use (through the mail for example), would be indistinguishable from our current drug *use* situation, but would give us a fighting chance to eliminate the violent crime aspect of prohibition.  It also provides a reasonable framework for full taxation and national price competition (putting unsustainable cost pressure on illegal dealers), and can even be extended (through NAFTA), to deny *billions* of dollars every year to central and south american crime syndicates.

Though during the time when they put down Come Together, it was believed that he had the refinished Ric with him.

Paul's tone was a variety of things, but most of all it was a high quality tube studio compressor he used extensively.

I'm currently in a discussion with a few friends about a particular issue, and I'm not sure how I feel about it.

The chip damage and the stagger provides time enough for me to get shots off with the Hurricane. This tactic is sufficient enough for me to deal with general enemies. 

But I agree to a point. The Singularity-Adept really can't bank on priming and detonating their own explosions. They *can* self-detonate, but it requires the player to operate within a terrifying and narrow margin of error. As a duder who isn't very good at video games, that's probably not a square deal.

I love the new Singularity Adept much in the same way I like the Paladin. I'm now a de facto shield stripper. 200+ damage p/second isn't monumental on Gold, but that chip damage plus the overwhelming assault from a Hurricane slotted with Disruptor Ammo helps the Adept soften the front lines up. Shockwave can stagger pretty much everything, and Warp is there to really hurt the armored guys. 

Maybe I'm in the minority on this, but I always found the Human Adept to be dependent on other strong power users. Singularity wasn't useful in my playstyle before, but is easier to incorporate as a support-type now.

I feel your pain. It's never fun to be in a bad training environment. I've been in the same boat before and it's no fun.

What you've described is a cancerous, anal-cyst of a training environment. It sounds like a lot of pressure, rules, and expectations that aren't necessary for learning jiu-jitsu. It's important to find a place that is more relaxed and focused on learning.

I'd suggest finding a school with a more chill atmosphere, where the instructors are more focused on teaching technique and having a good time, rather than enforcing a bunch of rules and regulations. Look for a school that emphasizes technique, learning, and having fun.

I think Tron is an awesome movie, but it really depends on who you are and what you're looking for in a movie. I personally love the visuals, the soundtrack, and the overall story. However, some people might find it too slow or too sci-fi. 

If you're considering watching Tron, it's important to think about what you're looking for in a movie. Are you looking for a movie with a lot of action? Or are you looking for something more thought-provoking? Are you looking for something that will make you think, or something that will make you laugh? 

No matter what you're looking for, Tron is definitely worth considering. It's a classic movie that has stood the test of time, and it's still as entertaining as it was when it first came out.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/uwaterloo with title ""I think tron is awesome, but it depends on who you are.

It is an awesome program, and you do learn a lot. While it is kind of competitive, we are a very cohesive bunch (together from start to finish) and as such, we try to help each other as much as possible. The amount of cooperation I have seen is really heartwarming. 

In addition, we learn a lot, but we don't go very much in depth. Last term, for example, I had my first mechanical design job. I hadn't learned much regarding nuts, screws, and washers. The senior engineer at the company explained, though, and thanks to the background we had gotten, I understood it really well. Full responsibility was handed over to me for about three weeks. 

You will probably be biased to one subject or the other, but you will learn how everything else is connected. If it is for you, you will really love it. 

Why do you want to go into tron?

tl;dr I think tron is awesome, but it depends on who you are. Why are you considering it?

It's true that learning the game of Dota 2 will help you to learn the heroes naturally, as you will understand the mechanics and strategies of the game better. However, there are some heroes that require a different kind of skill to play, which is micro-intensive. These heroes require quick decision making, faster reflexes, and a better understanding of how the hero works in order to be successful. So, while learning the game will help you with most heroes, there are some that require a different kind of skill to be successful.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/DotA2 with title ""learn the game and learning the heroes will come naturally. the only real exception to this i would say are micro-intensive heroes, in which a completely different kind of skill is required.""","in my limited experience i find that learning the game first and getting your general mechanics down is a lot more important than learning individual heroes. if you have a good general knowledge of skill interactions and skill usages(which you can obtain from both playing against certain heroes and with certain heroes on your team, i.e. by not necessarily playing the hero itself) and decent mechanical skill, then playing a hero you've not played before becomes a LOT easier. 

personally i just played the heroes i liked playing, and occasionally when i went out of my comfort zone with heroes i hadn't played before i still did pretty well as the general mechanical skill and game knowledge i'd built up from say, my first game as enigma(the first hero i played) to my first game as jakiro(couple days ago) made both experiences completely different and i played a pretty semi-decent jakiro.

I'm a Christian and I recently found out that a close friend of mine is in a relationship with an absolute asshole. I knew that he was bad news from the start, but I never said anything to her about it. Now I'm hearing that he's even worse than I thought, and I'm so upset with myself for not standing up for her and trying to stop it. I feel like I could have done something to prevent her from getting hurt, but I didn't. I feel like I've let her down, and I'm not sure what to do now.

Mostly due to the fact that people would talk to me and the idea of a God that loves me when pretty much no else has is appealing. But I'm sure as hell not religious and I'm defiantly closer to the atheist side then the Christian... But what if we're wrong? I sure as hell know I've messed up much easier questions then eternal life/damnation and suffering.
Number 2 being - I grew up in a pretty fucked up house. Abuse, neglect, parents who hated each other but stayed together to help me (Don't do it, it doesn't do jack shit other then make your kid miserable) and I got kicked out of schools pretty much everywhere. This all led to me not having friends like at all. Ever. I never stayed in a school more then a year until high school. My freshman year, I had a theater class that I got stuck in because everything was full. We were assigned partners and pretty much the whole class was spent with them. What do you know I get paired with the sweetest, smartest, most attractive girl I've ever met in my life (Ok she's not the most attractive looking back, But she was a looker). The first few weeks are awkward as hell, as you might imagine. But eventually we start talking and we bonded. Like super bonded. Like we were inseparable for most of high school. She took so much shit over talking to me, but it never stopped her. After 2 or so years, I finally worked up the confidence to ask her out. I planned and I planned, I picked a date, I knew exactly what I was going to say and I set out for her house with determination. I bought flowers and everything. I get to her house and let myself in (Best friends and I have an abusive family, I spent more time there then I did at my house) and walk up to her room. I turn the corner to go in and there she is kissing some guy. Ofc I'm crushed so I high tail it the hell out of dodge. Never said a word about it, and she never found it. Later on she introduced me and I ofc had to pretend it was the best thing ever. But this guy was a class A fuckhead. (Why are women attracted to that... Someone explain that) I hated him from the start, but tried to support her. Worst mistake I ever made. About four months after I found out, He drugged and raped her. She won't come near a single man without the most hateful and fear filled expression. To this day I hate myself for not telling her I hated him and that he wasn't someone she wanted to be around. I fear that I (Regardless of if it was fault or not) failed to keep her safe. Sorry for the long ass walk.

It's true that sometimes who you know can be more helpful than what you know. In the field of ecology, networking and collaboration are key.

Person A went to Berkeley. You decide to look into Berkeley's programs. You find that person A knows many of the faculty members as they were very active in the department. You submit your application to the person with the project you're most interested in, (person B) but you say is okay if it doesn't work out with them, you wouldn't mind working with someone else. Person B sees person A on your references list and remembers that person A still has his Janis Joplin album and has been meaning to call him anyway! He calls up person A, they catch up, then B asks A about you. A raves about you and says ""you'd be missing out if you didn't take this wonderful person on.""

Japan has been an economic powerhouse for decades, but it seems that the country has been getting lazy lately. With the rise of other Asian countries such as China and South Korea, Japan is facing more competition than ever before. Companies are moving their production to countries with cheaper labor costs, and Japan is losing its competitive edge. The government has been trying to stimulate the economy, but it seems that the country is still struggling to keep up with the rest of the world.

The main focus was your question. His thoughts on it was that Japanese game developers had gotten complacent and no longer create games that are as interesting as they had in the past. That the cool visuals are there but a good narrative is missing.

Also Japan had always made game for it's markets first and then released them to the rest of the world. Now there are more game developers making games geared towards US and Euro sales. Go and look at the games released in the 80's and 90's, and compare them to the release lists from 00's. I would think that the 00's list might be bigger and has a more diverse list of developers

Over the last decade there has been a major shift in what type of games are available. The 80's had a few types that the 90's expanded on that list and the 00's saw those game types multiply by stitching together different types into new ""frankenstein"" game types.

The world of Hyrule is in a state of chaos. The land is in ruins, the people are suffering, and the gods are nowhere to be found.

&gt;I would love to see a Zelda title taking place so far in the future that the current timeline either is blurred to irrelevancy or converges somehow into a single thread. I'm thinking about 1000 years or so passes by, and the fantastical world we once knew is just a myth among the inhabitants of Hyrule.
&gt;
&gt;I'm thinking of a dystopian future where tech has replaced magic/potions/etc and most organic things. It's a dirty and sad place filled with machines and metal. The gods haven't made themselves present since the last game (chronologically) in the timeline(s).
&gt;
&gt;Link's name is relevant now from a technology standpoint. I imagine Link minding his own business walking down an alleyway on his way to meet up with his friends, when he hears a woman being assaulted. It's Zelda. Link steps in, despite his usual apathetic tendencies (demonstrated in earlier cut scenes leading up to this point). Zelda is ungrateful, claims she could have taken care of herself, and walks away in a huff. Link pursues her, but loses her around a corner. He finds himself in an unfamiliar part of town, and as he's walking and taking in his surroundings, he falls through deteriorated street into some underground passages. Perhaps he stumbles upon the reason why the gods haven't been present in so long. Perhaps he finds an entrances to some of the ""old"" Hyrule. Perhaps a lot of things...
&gt;
&gt;It can go a lot of different ways, but I'm very interested in a total departure with regards to tone and setting. At the same time, weaving in the traditional play-mechanics we've all grown to love and call ""a Zelda game"".

It's not often that we hear about how easy it is to establish identity in the UK. But, it is true. Establishing identity is an incredibly simple process, and if there's any doubt then you'll be arrested.

It's important to remember that the police and other authorities have the power to ask for proof of identity at any time. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to investigate a crime or to ensure that someone is who they say they are. In order to establish identity, you will need to provide documents such as a valid passport, driving licence, or birth certificate.

It's also important to note that if you fail to provide proof of identity when asked, you can be arrested. The police have the power to arrest someone who they believe is not who they say they are. So, it's always important to have your identity documents with you at all times.

When the 999 call is made, by either someone who heard the gunshot, or the homeowner who's defended himself, an ARV (armed response vehicle) **will** be sent out. The guy with the gun, whomever it may be, will be ordered to put the weapon down. 

If he owns a shotgun/rifle, then there will be a 99% chance that he'll also possess the shotgun certificate or FAC (Firearms certificate) to go along with it. This will be recorded on a database and will enable the police to establish whether he is the legal owner of the firearm very quickly.

The police do not have to arrest someone to talk to them. The police will talk to the person who used self defence in the household, be it for a few minutes longer, to establish the basic runthrough of events. If everything checks out, there are witnesses etc, then normally you'll just be asked to go to the station to give a statement, and possibly further questioning. If there are any discrepancies, etc, you'll probably be arrested.

Whether or not it shows depends on the size of the smaller, handsome person and the digestion process of the fat person. When they munch it down, the smaller person has a 1/32 chance of still being alive. In other cases, the fat person remains fat forever, but can still munch down other smaller people that will reset the 1/32 chance for them. In the rare case that the smaller person survives, they can, in turn, start eating up the conscience of the fat person from within. This is a 100% deliberate choice. If the smaller person decided they like being inside the big person, they can tingle their brains and ask for more candy, and the fat person will inject more sugars into their body, for the smaller person to eat. They have to survive too, you know. But if the smaller person decides they want out and start eating the conscience, at one point, the rest of the triggers will stop working.

Hey everyone,

I'm a Zerg player and I'm trying to figure out the best way to defend against air attacks. I know that investing in Queens and Overseers is the best way to get anti-air defense, but it can be expensive and you don't always have the resources. On the other hand, making 3+ Spores can provide a good defense against air attacks, but it can be hard to cover all of your tech buildings, bases and drones.

Thanks for your help!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/allthingszerg with title ""Either you invest in Queens for AA and Overseer's for detection, or you make 3+ Spores to cover all of your tech buildings, bases and drones.""","You have to hit all of your defensive timings - if you don't know what your defensive timings are, watch some pro games. You will see terran put up turrets after a certain point, some Zerg lay spore crawlers in advance, and  most common protoss timing is a cannon or observer to prevent burrowed warfare.

Banshee harassment made 6 queens the standard for some players. I strongly suggest getting upwards of 4-6 queens against terran specifically for dealing with early banshees and hellions.

In terms of detection, cloak banshees are the reason for most early lairs. I generally go for lair tech only after +1 armor and ranged are done, otherwise I feel I am going for it far too early.

&gt;It seems to me to be a disagreement whereby you are saying the situation where men pay more is OK and others are saying it is not.

No, I'm specifically trying (and apparently failing) to say this is NOT okay, but unfortunately it is currently how it is (or at least this has been the expectation I've seen from pretty much everyone, male or female).  What I'm then saying is that because it is how it is (at least how I've seen it be), being up front about one's expectations prevents the (unfortunate) reality of how it is.

__I fully admit I'm saying this very badly.__

&gt;Why did you see the need to create a new thread to talk about this? What was wrong with the old thread where you had a very large number of comments, and which was on the front page?

My problem was it was pretty much just you and I going back and forth, and I wanted to get help trying to understand where the disconnect was.  After looking back at my initial point (after what someone else said) I realized I had worded things very badly.

&gt;Is this some sort of attempt to gain protection from the men on this board? It comes across as a bit ""help! some men are bullying me!"" appeal.

Sorry, that wasn't my intention.  My intention was specifically to get help clarifying either where I was going wrong in communicating what I was trying to communicate, or where I was going wrong in trying to understand what you were trying to say.  Barring that, if I was actually reading you correctly, I wanted confirmation of that, rather than leaving it as me being unsure.

Also, you have repeatedly treated me as if I'm the one asking to be paid for, or as if I am a woman.  I should probably let you know that I'm a man.

&gt;I don't know what that means but I don't really have any idea who people are as far as interacting with them before as I have a bad memory for that sort of thing.

If I hadn't had so many upvotes on your username, I probably would have just written you off rather than trying to understand where the issue was.

You're probably right that this is a much better method.  I try to react to what is being said as well, but I'll admit that seeing my past voting record on a person probably does bias me towards them (either positively or negatively).

With its unlimited power, do you even think it cares about a damned thing that happens on Earth?

Hey everyone!

I recently watched a video that really inspired me and I wanted to share it with the r/gamedev community. The video is about finding a driving principle in life, no matter what field you are in. It encourages us to find something we believe in and do something to make a positive change in the world. 

This video is a great reminder that we all have the power to make a difference. Even if you are just starting out in the game development industry, you can still make a difference. We can all use our skills and passions to create something that makes a positive impact on the world. 

So, let's all take a moment to think about what we believe in and how we can use our talents to make a difference. What can you do to make a positive change in the world?

Thanks for reading, and I hope this video inspired you as much as it did me.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/gamedev with title ""This video is to show you that you can live your life with a driving principle, no matter what field you are in. Find something that you believe in and do something to change the world.""","I have to disagree with you on what this video is actually about. Bret is trying to show developers that you can live your life with a driving principle.

The demos that he shows are there to help drive home his point that you don't have to be a journalist or some sort of modern day Martin Luther King in order to make a difference. 

I title this ""Every Developer Should See This"" because I absolutely believe that you can make a difference in any field, especially one related to technology.

It isn't immediately obvious how a game developer can live by a driving principle, but I think this talk helps to enlighten us to see that there are more possibilities than just making games that people like to play.

I hope the majority of the people who read these comments and watch the video realize that finding out what you stand for is very important. Doing something about it is even more important.

TL;DR - This video is to show you that you can live your life with a driving principle, no matter what field you are in. Find something that you believe in and do something to change the world."

Hey everyone! 

It's great to be back on campus and the weather has been perfect so far! Let's all make sure we stay safe and take precautions. 

We have a great community here at NAU and it's important to get to know your classmates and neighbors. There are plenty of clubs and organizations to join, so don't miss out! 

Also, don't forget to check out all the important pages on the NAU website and make sure to check your LOUIE account often for payment updates. 

Welcome back, everyone! Let's make it a great semester!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/NAU with title ""Good weather, good community, be smart and safe, join clubs, get to know your classmates and neighbors. Check out these pages:      and check your LOUIE account often for payment updates""","Pros: Cool fall and spring, moderate summers, SNOW!!! It snows in the winter, wide selection of dining options, expansive amount of resources for freshmen and undergrads, smaller class sizes, hundreds of official clubs, including club sports like Karate, Youn Wha Ryu, Roller Derby, Water Polo, USA Archery, Badjakcs (dance), Ultimate Frisbee, Quidditch, Scooting, as well as non-sport clubs and organizations, like the Anime club, Philosophy club, ASNAU (Student Gov't), PRISM (People Respecting Individuals and Sexual Minorities), and a group for just about every foreign language, political interest, and religion imaginable. 
Cons: wind. Just the fucking wind. Summers are a little warmer than what people expect (80-85 during the day), Construction projects - there's always something happening somewhere, buses are packed when it starts getting cold b/c nobody wants to walk. 

Things you should know: 1) If you drink or do other drugs, be discrete about it. If you don't cause trouble or blow your horn about drinking, you won't get into trouble. You should also know that NOBODY can enter your dorm room without your permission. An RA can open up and see if you're okay if he or she suspects you are in need of serious medical attention, service workers can enter when you are gone to affect repairs on internet, plumbing, electric, etc, and you must open up for Police IF AND ONLY IF they have a warrant for your arrest/search/seizure of property. THAT BEING SAID, do not abuse these benefits of living on campus. Be considerate to your neighbors and uniformed officials. Be respectful of those around you and be responsible for your actions. 2) You're going to get a lanyard. Don't. fucking. wear it. Put that shit away. Nobody wants to see your I.D. hanging from your neck, and everybody hates that you have your life attached to it, with the end hanging out of your pocket. Both of these are dumb-ass moves to pull. Don't be an obvious freshman. Put your I.D. in your wallet/purse and put your keys in your pocket. 3) Remember what being a freshman was like in high school? It'll be kind of like that, except you won't (hopefully) be as awkward. People will be a little more accepting of you and interested in you, but don't let that make you forget your manners or your intelligence. 4) Keep on top of due dates not only for homework, but things like exams, enrollment dates, add/drop/withdraw dates, and financial dues.

Social life: My best advice is: If you want to buy your friends, join a fraternity or sorority. I'm not saying you won't meet great people, but understand that you are buying your way into a social sect. If that's not for you, see option 2: If you want to make legitimate friends (not that there's something wrong with fratbros/sorohoes), attend the club info fair and join some clubs that interest you. If you're religious, join the religious club of your choice. You also don't have to be religious to make friends who are. I'm part of NAU Chabad, the Jewish organization on campus, and I'm not even Jewish. I don't even have Jewish ancestors or relatives, to my knowledge. Talk to your classmates every day if you can, and meet all your neighbors right away. Don't be the awkward guy or girl who never says hi in the hallway and doesn't know his or her neighbors names. You live with these people. Be their friends.

Good luck!!!

What's the best topping for a hot dog?

We've all heard of EVE Online, the massive sandbox MMO that has some of the most epic battles in gaming. But don't expect to see battles anywhere near the scale you see in EVE in other games. While other games may have large-scale battles, they pale in comparison to the massive battles that EVE can offer. The sheer number of players, ships, and other assets that can be involved in a single battle in EVE is staggering. Even if a game were to attempt to replicate the scale of battles in EVE, it would be difficult to capture the same intensity and complexity. So while other games may have large-scale battles, they won't be able to match the scale and intensity of those in EVE.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Games with title ""Don't expect to see battles anywhere near the scale you see in EVE.""","Go play Guild Wars 2, step into World vs World and watch what happens when your 100 players runs into the enemy group of 100 players.

It's becoming increasingly clear that the Republican party is no longer a party of patriotism and loyalty to the United States. Instead, they have become a party of obstruction, lies, and treason. It's no longer enough to disagree with the other side; they are actively working against the interests of the American people. From their refusal to pass legislation that would help the economy, to their attempts to undermine our democracy, it's clear that the Republican party is no longer loyal to the United States.

I was driving home from work the other day and I stopped at a red light. All of a sudden, I hear a voice coming from the car next to me. It was a police officer singing along to a song on the radio. I couldn't help but join in and before I knew it, we were singing a duet together! It was so unexpected and I was a bit embarrassed, but it was also pretty awesome. I had to tell Reddit about it!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""Sang duet with cop at red light, had to tell Reddit.""","It may sound a bit lame, btu here's mine:  I was driving in my Explorer in a small town in MD when i came to a red light.  I like country music, so this new song ""Cruise"" by Florida Georgia Line came on, I had my windows rolled down and the volume cranked up.  It was just one of those songs you can't not roll down the windows and blast.  A while ago, Maryland instituted noise violations, and would ticket you for having your music too loud.  I believe the measure is that it can't be heard more than 5 feet from hyour vehicle.  Anyway, they just recently started enforcing it.  So here I am sitting at a red light, and a MD state trooper pulls up next to me, in a turn line.  I'm rocking out and singing along when I turn my head and see him staring at me.  I think ""CRAP!"" and drop the music real low.  The trooper rolls down his window with the same unchanging stern look and says ""Excuse mer sir!""  I sheepishly replied ""Yes officer?""  He glared at me for what felt like an hour before breaking a smile and saying ""Turn that shit up!  I love that song!""  I laughed, turned it up, and we had about a half minute duet between our cars until the light changed.  Driving away I thought to myself ""Wow, that went better than expected!""

Every morning, we would load a freezer full of these meat packs into the bed of the pickup truck.

Long hours, but every day, lunch was at a different bar. I was underage but with enough guys who weren't and we were low key so nobody questioned that I was there. 

Anyway, myself and another guy started chatting up our waitresses and we agreed to meet up later when their shift ended. We were in the 'burbs, about 40 miles from downtown/home/office.

My friend and I got in his car, and started driving towards the bar. we were early, so I asked him to pull into the nearby store so I could buy some cloves. 

On the way out, he peels out in the parking lot. 

This catches a cop's attention. He kicks his lights on and pulls us over. 

Of course he wants licence, registration, proof of insurance while he lectures my coworker about driving recklessly in a parking lot

This is where things start to go sideways. 

The car is not in his name. His explanation sounds shady to me, even. His license is in order, but I think his insurance has expired... 

The cop calls for backup, and then 3 or 4 more squad cars arrive, the cops pull us out and ask to search our bodies and the car. I protest, (since I'm kind of drunk and underage) but eventually give in. Coworker does the same. 

There's a sawed off shotgun in the trunk... serials filed off and shorter than AZ laws permit. 

In the meantime, 3 more squad cars have arrived, including a K9 SUV and I swear to FSM... A helicopter overhead.

By this time, my buzz is totally killed and I figure we're mighty fucked; I can't imagine that they would pour this kind of resource into a stop and NOT arrest us. 

After all that though, one of the cops comes up and says that the shotgun has to be confiscated; but if we promise to get back in the car and get the hell out of his town, that we were free to go. No explanation was offered and we took off before they could change their minds. We didn't even get a ticket for the original offense.

I recently got caught driving without car insurance for two years. I was expecting a hefty fine of $2000-$10,000 and/or 30 days in jail, but instead, I was let go with a warning.

The car followed right behind me. At the next stop sign I didn't stop but did a u-turn so I can see who was being a douche.  It was a cop cruiser, and his flashers came on.  They blocked my way and stared, to see if I was gonna try and run I'd imagine.  I pointed meekly at the sidewalk where I could park, so they let me while they did their own u-turn and stopped behind me.

I have no idea if they know I did or not so I just said, no...just parking insurance..?  They asked what I mean, I said fire and theft.  He says to step out of the car.  They ask me and my sister in law, separately, how we knew each other (probably to make sure she wasn't a hooker), and a whole bunch of other questions including what work did I do (which was stockroom duty/shipping at Zellers).  They then tell me to wait there and they went and sat in their cruiser for a looong time.  When they come back, he asks me if I know the penalty for driving without insurance was, and I said no.  He told me it was between 2000-10000 fine and/or 30 days in jail.  I just said, ohh... He then asked me how I was going to get home.  I said I dunno...?  He said that I wouldn't be allowed to drive the car home.  He said he'd let me go with a warning this time, that I shouldn't do it again or they'd charge me to the fullest.

It's a shame that Riot had to take such a harsh stance against Frost, but at the same time they did break the rules. I think Riot should have had booths at the event, like they do at LCS events, where they could have talked to the players and given them a warning or punishment. This would have been a much better way to handle the situation rather than just banning them outright. I understand that Riot wants to be taken seriously, but I think this was a little too extreme.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/leagueoflegends with title ""Riot should have had booths, but at the same time Frost did break the rules""","I kinda of have issue with putting blame on just one party.

Yes, I agree 154.37 (repeating, of course) % that Riot should have had booths (or at least some sort of method blocking the minimap). They offer so many positive benefits that its almost a necessity. Hell, given the chance I'd argue this with Carmac, who is against the idea of booths (just look at any IEM).

BUT looking behind you is against the rules that Riot set in place before the tournament began.  And rules is rules. You don't see guys running up and down a court in basketball not dribbling the ball because it is easier and faster that way.  You don't see American Footballers making horse-collar tackles because its a good place to get a grip - and if they do, they get penalized.

For those saying riot is just using frost as a fall guy: Redbeard posted this, and might have been skipped over, in the rulings post:

""In hindsight, the potential visibility of minimap screens for players was a mistake. Despite on-site referees, close monitoring of player cams backstage, and stage design that ensured players would have to turn more than 90 degrees to be able to catch a glimpse of the minimaps, even the possibility of unfair play was simply unacceptable. We’re taking steps to ensure the minimap screens are not visible to players.""

You're not supporting the article solely with your comment, so I don't think you should be getting quite so downvoted.

And his followup was over-the-top insulting.  Normally, I would re-read something to give specific quotes and details, but it upsets me way too much to be worth it.  

If the entire article was a single sentence that said, ""Being a straight white male in the US often gives you a lot of privileges, sort of like starting with extra points in character creation in a RPG.""  It would be totally fine.  That's true!  It's a true thing to say!  It's not speaking in absolutes and it doesn't minimize people's experiences.  The actual article, however, does.

The article wasn't written to change anyone's mind, but it was framed like it was.  Because the premise is one that would be useful to reach out to people who haven't thought much about gender politics or who are more moderate on those issues.  It devolved from a decent premise into a ""you don't know how hard life *really* is"" and started belaboring the point using insular language and making lots of referential nods to existing feminist culture.  

A lot of people on his blog, on Gawker, and I believe here on Reddit gave him a lot of very level-headed, calm, and surprisingly thorough feedback on why he was off-base and why his article wasn't successful; in other words, they furthered the discussion.  His response was no more thought out than ""I'm right, you're wrong; my original article was perfect in every way and if you disagree, you're 'mansplaining' and an idiot.""  

That's not the way to spread acceptance of your ideas; that's being a ideologue. It's essentially screaming at people, and then plugging your ears.  That's not what feminism should be about; that's just a religion.

Fat and water don't bond in the same way that oil and water don't. Fat is a hydrophobic molecule, meaning it repels water. This is why fat and water don't mix and why they separate when they are combined. This is also why you can't make a sauce with just fat and water.

However, fat can be emulsified with water, meaning it can be suspended in water in the form of tiny droplets. This is done through the addition of emulsifiers such as lecithin or egg yolks. These emulsifiers work by coating the fat droplets and preventing them from clumping together. This allows the fat to be suspended in the water, creating a creamy sauce or dressing. 

Hope this helps!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskCulinary with title ""Fat and water don't bond.""","From a chemical standpoint, it has to do with the incorporation of fat and liquids in your final product. Cookie dough is an emulsion - a mixture of two compounds (fat and water) that can't usually bond. Emulsions are fragile by nature, and prone to breaking. Keeping cookie dough too long at room temperature, over handling while shaping - these are things that will ""break"" your emulsion, and cause the fat to separate into the oily substance you sometimes find in flat cookies. Chilling your dough before forming and before baking, and any time that it begins to get overwarm, helps to keep the dough intact.

The greatest benefit, however, is during baking itself. Cookie recipes are often chemically leavened - with baking powder or baking soda. And cookie recipes often contain butter. Butter is itself an emulsion, being composed of several parts fat (about 80% in the states) and water (along with small quantities of sugar and protein). When butter is heated in a mixture like cookie dough, one of two things may happen: The emulsion may break, and the fat begin to leak, OR the water may turn to steam, creating small pockets of water vapor that act as barriers to fat and help the product to rise. Bringing your dough rapidly from chilled to oven temperature allows water to steam before the fat melts, keeping your cookie in one happy, homogeneous package - instead of spread onto your baking sheet.

TL;DR: Fat and water don't bond. "

I'm trying to branch out and learn more about the paleo lifestyle, and I've found a lot of interesting podcasts online. The problem is that I always read the summary of the podcast and then decide whether or not to listen to it based on that.

Upsampling and downsampling are two important concepts in digital audio production. Upsampling does nothing to the audio, it simply increases the sample rate of the audio file. Downsampling, on the other hand, reduces the sample rate of the audio file which can create quantization errors. To avoid these errors, it is important to use a process called dithering. Dithering helps to reduce the audible artifacts of quantization errors and is an important part of audio production. I highly recommend reading the Izotope Ozone manual to learn more about dithering and how to use it properly in your productions. The Izotope Ozone manual is full of great information and is a great resource for anyone looking to learn more about audio production.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/WeAreTheMusicMakers with title ""upsampling does nothing, downsampling creates quantization error. Also, DITHER RULES! I suggest reading about it in the Izotope Ozone manual. Those guys have awesome manuals.""","Upsampling effectively does nothing. It just adds more samples between the already recorded samples. This shouldn't change the sound at all. Raising the bit rate just adds more zeros at to the sample but doesn't change the value.

Downsampling is different. Let's say you record in 24bit/48k and you want to bounce a 16bit/44.1k CD mix. In some DAWs (Pro Tools for example) bouncing just truncates the bits and throws away samples based on some sort of algorithm. This causes a problem. Truncating bits creates what is called ""quantization error"" which in turn adds some nasty little noise to the mix. This raises the noise floor and effectively reduces the dynamic range of the mix even further than just recording in 16bit. To get around the quantization error, you must apply dither. Dither is noise but is ""good"" noise, it is very quiet and can be manipulated through psychoacoustic equalization or some other form of EQ to sound even quieter. Dither cancels out the harsh noise from quantization error and recreates a lot of the missing dynamic range. Dither lies at -90dB or lower btw, most people don't even hear it.

If OP sees this, I think this may be your issue. Quantization error noise can really tear up a mix. If you are bouncing at a bit rate lower than you recorded, apply some dither. Put it on the stereo mix bus and DO NOT apply any gain modification after dither, make sure all automation and level adjustments occur before the dither.

TL;DR: upsampling does nothing, downsampling creates quantization error. Also, DITHER RULES! I suggest reading about it in the Izotope Ozone manual. Those guys have awesome manuals."

What advice would you give to someone who is attending classes for the first time?

I'm sure many of us have been there before - attending classes for the first time can be a daunting experience. Here are some tips I've picked up over the years that have helped me make the most out of my classes:

1. Show up on time - Arriving to class on time shows respect for your professor and your classmates, and will make it much easier to stay engaged in the lecture.

2. Take notes - Taking notes during class is a great way to stay focused and organized. It also helps you retain information more effectively.

3. Ask questions - Don't be afraid to ask questions during class. Asking questions is a great way to get clarification on topics you don't understand and to get to know your professor better.

4. Participate in discussions - Participating in class discussions is a great way to get to know your classmates and to practice your communication skills.

5. Stay organized - Staying organized is key to success in classes. Make sure to keep track of due dates, assignments, and other important information.

Hey everyone,

I'm sure many of us have been in situations where we felt like we had to force a relationship to work. Whether it be a romantic relationship or a friendship, it can be really exhausting to try and make something work that just isn't there.

My advice is to focus on forming real friendships with people and let nature take its course. If it turns into something more, great! But if it doesn't, you still have a great friend.

It's so much easier to be yourself and let things happen naturally. Don't force a relationship, just let it happen.

Have you ever tried this approach?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/sex with title ""Focus on forming real friendships with people and let nature take it course.""","There's nothing wrong with being turned off by some ideas; everyone has their limits.

If you must consume erotic media (man's gotta *eat*), try tasteful art for a change.

When you meet a girl whose company you enjoy and for whom you care, your feelings for her won't just go away when you get into bed.  In fact, these feelings are often required for some people to feel comfortable enough to open up both literally and figuratively.  I think the reason you are having a hard time reconciling your feelings is because your ideas about sex are separate from your ideas of friendship when they are in fact very closely related.  My personal definition of romantic love is friendship plus mutual attraction.

I disagree, I think not only was Moffat a better writer but also a better showrunner than RTD. While RTD had some great ideas, Moffat was able to bring them to life in a way that was more engaging and exciting. He was able to craft more complex and interesting stories, and he was able to take risks that RTD was unwilling to take. His run on Doctor Who was far more experimental and creative, and it showed in the quality of the show. He was also able to bring out the best in the actors, creating some truly iconic performances. All in all, I think Moffat was a far better showrunner than RTD, and I believe that his run on Doctor Who will be remembered as one of the best.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/gallifrey with title ""I disagree, I think not only was Moffat a better writer but also a better showrunner than RTD.""","I'm going to disagree here.

However, I think that not only is Moffat a much better writer than RTD but he also a better showrunner.

During the RTD era there were many high points and great episodes (Dalek, Blink, Midnight, Etc.) but along with those there were some godawful terrible episodes (Slitheen two parter, Daleks in Manhattan two parter, Fear Her, etc.). The difference between these were staggering and you almost didn't know what you were getting from week to week. With Moffat's era there isn't a huge discrepancy from the high points to the low points. The worst of the episodes in Moffats era (Curse of the Black Spot, Night Terrors, etc.) are leaps and bounds better than the worst episodes of the RTD era. I'll even go as far as to say I think that the better episodes of Moffat's era are better than the better episodes of RTD's as well. 

I'll agree with The_Evil_Within in that RTD is a huge fan of the Deux Ex Machina.

I'll also agree that even though I love the direction Moffat has taken the show and think he's doing a great job, I think he's a better writer than a showrunner if I had to pick him to do just one job.

As a show runner, one should be willing to take risks and make bold decisions, even if it means killing off a beloved character. They should also know how to keep secrets and be able to maintain the suspense and mystery of a story without spoiling it for the audience. Lastly, the show runner should be telling the best story possible, regardless of where it takes them. It's important to stay true to the story and not be afraid to take risks. It's all about creating a captivating and engaging story that keeps viewers coming back for more.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/gallifrey with title ""A show runner should: Be willing to kill, know how to keep a secret and be telling the best story possible, regardless of where it takes them.""","The show could be dramatically improved, and this is a flaw of both RTD and Moffar, by doing one simple thing.  LET PEOPLE STAY DEAD.

No magic wave of the sonic, no half-regenerations, no 'wishing back to life'. STAY DEAD.

We as fans also have to accept this, it may be hard and difficult but it is *more narratively interesting*. I don't watch the Doctor to see what magic he is going to pull out of his ass this week but I do watch it to see this impossible man face impossible odds and how he fights them, sometimes his luck simply has to run out. This is a symptom of many of the so-so episodes. The Doctor is brilliant and powerful in his own way but he is not a god. I know I just said be willing to kill and have people stay dead but bring back the Time Lords or someone who is on an equal peg to him. It has gotten to a point where it is hard to even understand how a whole civilization of Time Lords got beat off the Daleks who simply are not all that good in New Who, despite all the fancy new powers.

It should also be the job of the show runner to not let the 'stars' dictate their character. Gillian and Darvill chose to leave, it was not because of the necessity of the plot but rather the plot was written because of it. This is wrong. I know you can't go around hiring a new companion every five minutes but pick a plot and stick with it. If they happen to die in the course of that great but make sure you have the contracts that it is not a forced decision. 

Lastly, and least likely, we need WAY less press. I remember when the first torrent hit ahead of the first episode airing and the buzz that episode gathered it was like a fire had been ignited in our minds and we were all trying to work out what was going on. Now the show is so popular it is practically impossible to avoid spoilers even in the ordinary press to what is going on. I don't want to know it is Karen Gillan's last episode because THAT IS THE NARRATIVE HIGH OF THE EPISODE. If you you are not going to do something completely out of left field then don't tell us the main plot point before the episode airs.

Our priest healer in WotLK was a train driver. He was a great healer and a great tank, but his main role was as a healer. He was able to keep us alive and healed through some of the toughest encounters while also being able to take some of the heat off the tank and help out with the damage.

Hey everyone,

I'm sure most of us have heard the phrase ""opposites attract,"" but I'm wondering if there is any truth to it when it comes to relationships. I'm a firm believer that goals, dreams and personal values are pretty critical components of a relationship.

Do you think it's important to have similar goals and values in order to have a successful relationship? Or do you think that having different goals and values can bring something unique to the table?

I'm interested to hear your thoughts.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/OkCupid with title ""Goals, dreams and personal values are pretty critical components of a relationship.""","I suppose there is plenty of truth in what you say.  I don't want to simply argue for no reason.  But I feel that sharing similar values is a pretty big deal.  An atheist might not gel as well with a devout catholic even if they have excellent chemistry.
I think there are details that you really really really miss here.  In the long term, there is more than just chemistry.  The new car smell in the relationship fades, and then you see truths you didn't see before.  Ignoring those flaws will make for a bad bad relationship, no matter what kind it is.  I've experienced this myself and seen it before.
I agree that chemistry is super important, but sharing many values makes a huge difference in the long run.  I think that plenty of the answers you find in okcupid eventually start to paint a picture that makes those percentages of more than zero value.  I want to really send this message home, two people can fall in love and even stick together for 3-9 months with great chemistry.  But is that the goal?  For many, absolutely, but then why bother with okcupid at all?  Why not just find someone you can tolerate at a bar or plentyoffish?  I think many on okcupid aren't looking for a fling or some sort of short term thing.  I think they really want something like marriage or someone to spend their life with and have kids with and so on.  Many relationships end when, if they looked at their personal values and compared, they may not have wanted to start the relationship at all.
**TL;DR Goals, dreams and personal values are pretty critical components of a relationship.**"

I recently heard about a friend of mine who decided to put 500k into a penny stock. He was told it was mathematically feasible, but very unlikely to work in his favor. After a few weeks, he was shocked to find out that the stock had gone up significantly, and he had made a decent profit on his investment.

This story is a great example of why it's important to be careful when investing in penny stocks. While they may have the potential to make you a lot of money, they can also be incredibly risky. If you're considering investing in penny stocks, make sure you do your research and understand the risks before you put your money on the line.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/stocks with title ""mathematically feasible but very unlikely putting 500k into a penny stock would work in your favor""","There is no way you can put 500k into one penny stock and expect to sell all your shares in one day.

It's no secret that the financial crisis of 2008 was caused by a number of factors. One of the biggest contributing factors was the refusal to regulate derivatives such as credit default swaps, which played a significant role in the crisis. Additionally, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act also allowed for the risky investments that caused the crisis. Contrary to popular belief, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were actually some of the safest institutions in the market.

Despite the severity of the crisis, the recovery has actually been fairly robust. The reason why the recovery hasn't been stronger is mostly due to the actions of Republicans in Congress, state legislatures, and local legislatures. These lawmakers have consistently blocked measures that would help stimulate the economy and create jobs, which has hindered the recovery.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/politics with title ""You dont seem to know what a credit default swap is. Refusal to regulate derivatives along with the repeal of glass steagal both played significant roles in the crisis. Fannie and freddie were among the safest institutions in the market. The recovery has actually been fairly robust, and the reason its not stronger is mostly because of republicans in congress and in state and local legislatures.""","&gt;Please point me to which provision removed regulation on credit default swaps, which would have prevented the crisis. 

First, are you really arguing that deregulation of derivatives didnt play a role in the crisis?

And um, credit default swaps caused the crisis? Do you even know what a credit default swap is? Its almost like youre just throwing words together in an attempt to arrive at a coherent sounding argument. Because it should be obvious that credit defaults swaps didnt cause the crisis, just by the definition of the term. 

Credit default swaps are what sank AIG. But they didnt cause the crisis. A credit default swap is essentially insurance on a financial security. If the issuer of the bond thats insured defaults, you get paid by the agency that you insured it with (probably AIG).

CDS's didnt cause the crisis. I mean, just ask yourself, *why* did the insured securities default in the first place?? *That,* the reason why the default happened, is what caused the crisis.

And the failure to regulate derivatives *directly* ties in with CDS. In the derivative market, where people are making bets on the value of a MBS without actually owning it, any number of people can take out a credit default swap on an MBS. Its like your neighbor taking insurance out on your house and then burning it down. There was no regulation there when common sense overwhelmingly indicated that there should be.

&gt;Blah, blah, blah. This isn't why people in my town bought multiple condos for $400,000 a piece, when they could only rent then out for $15,000/yr. Anybody settling for a &lt;4% yield (especially when risk-free 10yr treasuries were offering close to 5%) is asking for disaster. 

This is just bullshit. Of course in your mind the crisis was just driven by poor people that took out mortgages they shouldnt have. 

In reality Gramm Leach Bliley ended the separation between investment and commercial banking. Your local bank could give you a mortgage, package it together with others, and sell it off. It ended really any correlation between the quality of the mortgage and the amount of money the bank issuing it made. You can say an individual shouldnt have taken out that mortgage, but basic economic theory should tell you that if banks make it easier to get mortgages, more people will take out mortgages.

Pretending that the repeal of glass steagal didnt enable the root cause of the crisis is just naive. 

&gt;Bush didn't hold a gun to their head and force them to sign their mortgages.

Obviously not. But you're basically acting like housing policy and financial regulation had nothing to do with the crisis, and thats just wrong. Just because bush didnt hold a gun to someones head and make them take out a mortgages doesnt mean his policies and the policies of his party didnt cause it.

&gt;Without this, it's impossible for any of the other shit to have happened. Remember, cause, not symptom.

You should really be telling yourself that, Mr. Credit-Default-Swaps-Cause-the-Crisis. Exactly what do you think I've got backwards?

&gt;The number of regulators at the SEC grew substantially under Bush. I can't find the chart now. Will look for it.

I dont know the number youre referring to, you could be right considering government employment surged under bush. but thats not my argument. Sure there might have been more regulators, they just werent doing their job. And thats exactly what i said. 

&gt;Sure, it doesn't help when the Democrat spawned agencies continue to create a market for subprime mortgages by buying them on the secondary market. Maybe it wasn't a huge amount, but still encouraged banks to continue to make risky loans.

How did they make the market more risky when [default rates on fannie and freddie mortages were between 4 - 5.5 percent at their worst,]( while [default rates on mortgages issued by commercial banks reached more than 11%?](

This one is really important, it goes directly to your point that fannie and freddie (and the community reinvestment act that concerned them) made the market more risky. [Loans by banks regulated by the CRA had lower default rates](

Furthermore, [the vast majority of loans issued during the crisis were issued by private banks](

So no, fannie and freddie and the CRA did not increase risk. In fact their default rates pretty conclusively prove that they were some of the safest institutions in the market.

&gt;The recovery is meager at best. Look at how much cash corporations are sitting on. The recovery is dependent on deleveraging. It could all have happened at once, or gradually. Maybe the stimulus helped soften the fall. But it's a natural cycle, that had to take its course either way.

Speaking of deleveraging, this is another place where obama has overseen a [tremendous recovery.](

How exactly is this recovery meager at best?? Private employment and GDP are both growing at the same pace they grew during the recovery in bush's first term. Corporate profits are at record highs. The dow has doubled. Manufacturing hasnt grown this much in decades. 

And even if it has been meager, which it hasnt, the american jobs act would have created 1.4 million jobs and your party blocked it! Not to mention all of the austerity and layoffs at the state level decreasing aggregate demand and increasing unemployment

Its quite obvious that you've reached your own conclusion about how you think the world works without first looking at the facts. Usually people, at least smart people, look at the facts and then make their opinions based on those facts. But you, not you. You've obviously made your decision based on your inherent biases. And then you went out and tried to find data that backs up your bias, and ignored any data that contradicted it.

**TL;DR** You dont seem to know what a credit default swap is. Refusal to regulate derivatives along with the repeal of glass steagal both played significant roles in the crisis. Fannie and freddie were among the safest institutions in the market. The recovery has actually been fairly robust, and the reason its not stronger is mostly because of republicans in congress and in state and local legislatures. "

Hello everyone!

I've been a long time fan of the Football Manager series and have had some great experiences with it. I'm looking for some updates on how good/in-depth this version is so I can decide if I want to get involved with another FM campaign.

I've always enjoyed the challenge of managing a club and taking them from the lower divisions to the top of the league. I find the tactical side of the game to be the most enjoyable and challenging part, and I also like to tinker with the player transfers.

I'm interested to hear from people who have played the latest version and whether it is still as good as previous versions. I'm also interested to hear about any new features or improvements that have been made.

Thanks in advance for any advice and opinions!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Games with title ""I ramble my previous experiences with FM and I'm looking for updates for how good/in-depth this version is to know whether I want to get involved with another FM campaign.""","Long-term CM player here.. started out playing CM 92-93 on the Amiga, CM Italia 93-94 on the Atari.. then 96-97, 97-98, 01-02 before eventually moving onto FM 05, 06, 08 &amp; 10. I haven't played any others since then but have put a fair amount of hours into FM10.. probably more than is healthy.

Anyway, I digress as this post isn't about that.

I went back to play 97-98 recently purely for nostalgic reasons and it was so simple.  Very simple.  Three subs on the bench in the Scottish league and one of those had to be a keeper. Hah, changed days!  What I missed most from that is being involved with the running of the club.  I love being able to take charge of training sessions, get board requests, send the scouts to foreign countries, develop youth players and everything else that 10 did.  What I hate most about it is the press conferences.  No, I like them... but what I actually hate is that you say one thing or even if you don't comment on it, and it picks that up as the main story which in turn upsets the entire squad or a player that goes in the huff.  I sincerely hope that this has been fixed for '13.  What I'm really looking forward to is the challenges.  The ones where you're bottom of the table at Christmas and have to save the club from relegation.  This has the potential to be an excellent feature and I sincerely hope that it is.

As someone with a degree in Computer Science and a Software Engineering internship under my belt, I highly recommend either CS or SE as more suitable degrees for aspiring game developers. Not only will they teach you the technical skills needed to develop games, but they will also give you a better understanding of the industry and the development process. Additionally, I highly recommend getting an internship. It will give you invaluable experience and help you stand out from the crowd when applying for jobs. Good luck!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/gamedev with title ""I recommend CS or SE as more suitable degrees. Also, get an internship.""","I agree with Khael8. That being said, I might recommend something other than a game design degree. If you're interested in the programming side (as it seems you are), I would suggest Computer Science or Software Engineering. Not as a side lesson like it would be for a game design degree, but as a full on course of study. There are a couple reasons for that. First, if you pick a game design degree, there's a good chance you're going to be stuck, and if you ever change your mind about your career down the line, you're out of luck. With CS or SE you're a lot more marketable and you'll have more flexibility when it comes to your career. Next, you'll learn more programming doing this than a game design degree. And if you want to work for a developer, the usual jack of all trades type person isn't always what they want. Many developers want someone who is VERY good at a specific thing. They want their artists to be great artists, their audio guys to be great with audio, and they want their programmers to be great programmers. *Normally* they don't need their programmers being great with sound and graphics, just the programming behind the implementations. This way, you'll be great at programming and along the way you can pick up the tools that artists use and learn those so you're at least familiar with them should you need to use it by yourself.

TL;DR: I recommend CS or SE as more suitable degrees. Also, get an internship."

When warmed up, CO2 'sublimates' from a solid straight to the gas we breathe every day.  When placed in water, dry ice warms up very fast.  So fast, that the sublimating CO2 forms bubbles of very cold CO2 gas in the water.  When these bubbles reach the surface and the cold CO2 gas is released, it cools down the air around it causing water to condense into a fine mist.  It is the condensed water vapor mist that is visible, and that the OP would like to use to visualize air flow. (independent source: 

Now then, would this work?  Sort of.  If you pass a small trail of mist into the case, you can see where the air is going based on how the mist moves through the case.  It won't work very well however, because the mist needs to remain visible to do its job.  First problem: case fans create a lot of turbulence.  They'll chop up any stream of mist that travels through them pretty good, and blow it around on the other side.  The second problem: air inside of a computer heats up.  Remember that the mist stream was created by by cooling down water vapor in the air.  Now, as that mist passes through the CPU or GPU, it gets heated back up and the mist goes away.

I'm a girl gamer and I'm proud of it. I love playing video games and I'm really good at them. But I've also noticed that some people think I'm pandering because I'm a girl.

I'm here to tell you that I'm not pandering. I'm just blessed with huge tits, which is something I can't control. I'm not trying to use my gender to my advantage—I just have a body type that some people find attractive.

So, if you see me playing video games and think I'm pandering, think again. I'm just a girl who loves gaming and happens to have big boobs.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/GirlGamers with title ""I wasn't pandering, I just have huge tits.

I have size G Boobs. I am not pandering here, if any shirt has the slightest of a V neck it'll plunge and look like massive cleavage.  A lot of people may find that I am pandering, but after years of hating my body, the size of my breasts and crying over how ""Nothing fits (at an affordable cost)"" I decided to just get over it.  None of my shirts properly button up.  The top button is not my friend.  (read: it never closes)

This is something I have to deal with. I'm currently a graduate student working on my thesis looking at sexual harassment on the XBLN, gamer girl identity and gender negotiation.  I have to battle being sexually objectified due to my breast size with my peers &amp; with my professors.

For instance: I'll never forget when I first came into my program a lot of the students were unsure where they wanted to take their research. I know where my research is heading towards and how I'm collecting my data, etc. I went to talk to one professor because he is well versed within media literacy and thought he'd be a great help.  Instead of listening to anything I was trying to tell him, he starred at my tits the whole time, interrupting me and making me feel humiliated.  I wasn't a person to him in that moment, but a sex object.  I felt myself getting frustrated. Red in the face. Angry. Finally without even looking me at the face he asked if I had any questions. Licked his lips. Disgusting.  

I just wanted to get out of there. I said no, and as I was turning to leave, he had the nerve to touch me.  Place his hand on my shoulder.  It would have seen innocent enough he hadn't spent the last 20 minutes starring at my chest.  

Anecdote aside, I find it funny and sad how men &amp; women try to police each other's bodies, clothing types, hair choices, or ways of speaking.

ITS FUCKING HOT OUTSIDE. I'm sitting in my house with the AC cranked up and it's still sweltering. What are some of your favorite ways to beat the heat?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""ITS FUCKING HOT OUTSIDE""","I live in Phoenix, Arizona.  

There's a lot that attracts people to the valley.  People come here to get away from the cold, but I've always wondered why.  A person can continue to put on layers and layers of clothes to get warm.  However, there are only so many layers of clothes you can take off to cool down though.  I would not recommend peeling layers of skin off.  

Someone once told me I didn't understand, because I've never had to scrape ice off of a car windshield.  I have never had to do that, but I have physically injured myself getting into my car in the summer.  The door handle is hot, the seats are like fire, and the metal part of the seat belt will literally blister your fingers, or god forbid it touches some mid-drift.

Also, there is a complete lack of character in the greater valley's architecture.  All the homes are stucco, and they are all the same color.  We literally have cookie cutter neighborhoods.  All the homes in these very common neighborhoods are EXACTLY the same except a slight difference in shades for the exterior paint. Out Downtown is nice, and has character, but during the day, only a few blocks are active, and same during the night.  It's great to look out, but it is not where you want to live.  This is known, so the only homes there are shacks filled by meth addicts or illegal immigrants. To be fair I will admit that there are the few areas in downtown Phoenix that are upscale, but they are not the norm.

Phoenix is also spread out.  Walk to the grocery story to pick up a few things? Only if you feel like walking 3 miles/4.8km in 110 degree/ 43 degree (Celsius) weather. 

Oh, and we're also racists according to everyone else in the nation.  If they lived here and understood how much illegal immigration effects us, others would understand.  We begged the federal government for help, and they refused.  Shit got real and now we all have a bad name.

Our education is ranked one of the lowest in the nation.  Some could say this is because of the large group of Spanish speaking students, the AIMS, or the teachers. 

Our winter's are nice for those who have ""migrated"" south.  Adapt to the weather, and all you get is the ability to freeze your ass off, with no snow. Win/Win?

Phoenix has two seasons: Summer, and January.  No fall colors, no spring flowers.  (Ok, maybe we do, but it's very short lived, and as far as the fall colors go, you have to plant trees yourself to see that).
If you want to see the colors change, you have to go for a scenic drive or hike up in the northern part of the country.

We have horrible care for the mentally ill also.  As a matter of fact, if you are mentally ill, you usually get off the hook cause we don't know what else to do with you!

There are pros to living here, they just aren't things that you can't find anywhere else.

It's cool. I can't stand going anywhere flat having lived in such a hilly place all my life. The city itself is quite piecemeal, with CBD being on a kind of raised platform of terraces (The street is called The Terrace), smooshed into the motorway, and with an old Cemetery full of trees and bushes that has been almost fully developed around, that is very relaxing to walk through.

Then there is Lambton Quay, the high end shopping street, which eventually flows into Cuba Mall (named after Cuba - we get a shitload of good Cuban imports here, especially coffee, if you come to Wellington you have to like coffee) which is a Bohemian shopping district, with some of the best clothing shops, and great food and bars. Courtney Place is full of clubs, and is pretty full with drunks most nights.

It's probably twenty minutes walk from one side of the city to the other, and when it's sunny the best path to take is along the harbour. There's a big town belt too, lots of MTB tracks, trees and stuff just sprout up from the footpaths, a well trimmed lawn looks very out of place, and the houses are a random assortment of styles that stick out from the green hillsides.

Lots of hipsters, lots of businessmen, it's the capital, so loads of politicians. People say its windy, but it's not that bad, and when the sun shines, it really godamn shines.

Although possible and also possibly safe, there's still a chance you could do a lot of harm than good - that's the chance you take.

I've heard good and bad about it.  People achieving the results they wanted or minor effects that were desired with minimal to no bad side effects.  I don't know if ""bad for your liver"" is the right term, rather you're putting more hormones, more ""stuff"" into your blood and your liver and kidney's have to work harder because they have a certain level programmed into them they want to maintain.  That being said, liver or kidney's that work harder are more likely to fail.

The only true advice i'd offer is, it's really up to you.  If you do decide bone up on the subject, /r/asktransgender has a lot of self medicated posts (posts for both full on transition and minor changes).

I'd like to add, there's a lot of non invasive things you could do to help promote more feminine changes.  Getting plenty of rest, lots of water, regularly changing sheets and pillow cases more often, moisturizing, etc are all the little things I do and my skin has softened and cleared up quite a bit.

I'm still on adderall, but I wanted to share something that has been helping me through my addiction. It's called Jesus Christ.

I know it sounds crazy, but I've found that praying to Jesus and reading the Bible helps me stay focused on my recovery. It gives me strength and hope in times of weakness and despair.

I hope this helps someone else out there who is struggling with addiction. God bless.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Drugs with title ""jesus christ. sorry still on addies, hope this will be of use to you""","Jhoppa's point is the main one; just like there can be a HUGE difference in concentration of THC between different plants (genetic engineering aside, lots of things like soil/climate/etc. can influence it), there can be large variation in concentration of mescaline among different cacti. I'd say the amount you have will almost certainly be enough to feel it, and is very unlikely to be too intense...If you've never done mescaline, let me try to describe it. 

A trip is like a roller-coaster ride, right? It's intense, it's exhilarating, it's fun, but at times can also be scary, depending on specifics about the particular ride (shoddy state fair roller coaster vs. Cedar Point) as well as your mindset going on to it (you're unlikely to enjoy even an awesome roller coaster if you're sick/upset etc.). Just like set and setting for a trip. Now, acid or shrooms are more like...Son of Beast from Kings Island in Ohio; it's the biggest wooden roller-coaster in the world. Which means that, it's intense and really awesome, but it has kind of a rickety feel to it that doesn't leave you feeling completely safe/secure/worry-free the whole time. Mescaline, on the other hand, is the Millenium Force. It takes you higher and faster than almost any other ride, but the whole time you feel completely safe, secure, in control, and are just *loving* it. (DMT, obviously, would be the Top Thrill Dragster =P ) Mescaline just feels so clean and exhilarating and everything is so amazingly beautiful. It's the strongest positive/euphoric ""push"" I've ever felt from a psychedelic, besides maybe 2C-P (or candyflipping). This is due to mescaline's phenethylamine structure; it is chemically more similar to MDMA or even amphetamine than to tryptamines like psilocybin (acid has structural similarities to both families).

In the type of dose you should be getting yourself into, it's an *extremely* functional trip. To give you an example, the first time I met and really got to know my current girlfriend of 2 years (we were neighbors in a dorm, this was the first time we hung out), my roommates and I were all tripping balls on mescaline. I had invited her and her roommate over at our place for dinner (cooked by me) to get to know each other. Now, her and her roommate are these two beautiful girls who we don't know at all and who (we would come to know but suspected) are totally innocent--neither of them had ever even drank or partied, much less smoked weed or done anything else. Anyway, while tripping balls on mescaline, I cooked a dinner for 5 people, we all had awesome conversation (despite being around new people who also happened to be gorgeous--probably would have been weird on acid or shrooms), they had no idea we were on anything and yeah long story short we've been dating for over 2 years based on *that* first impression. That's still one of, if not the most magical day of my life (first mescaline trip). For reference, that was on 40 0.7g capsules (so 28g) of powdered dried Peruvian Torch cactus. Unfortunately, that doesn't give you much help with your San Pedro.

tl;dr jesus christ. sorry still on addies, hope this will be of use to you"

It all depends on your climate, soil type, and the types of plants you want to grow. If you live in a cold climate, you may need to focus on hardy plants that can survive the winter. If you live in a warm climate, you may be able to grow a wider variety of plants. In terms of soil type, you'll want to make sure you have the right balance of nutrients for the types of plants you want to grow. Finally, you'll need to do some research on the types of plants that you want to grow and make sure you understand the requirements for those plants. With a little bit of research and planning, you can create a beautiful garden that will thrive in your climate and soil type.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/gardening with title ""It all depends.""","Not necessarily...  Plants are finicky organisms that can't talk and tell you what's wrong.  Depending the book you look at and the person you talk to, there are anywhere between something like 13 and 18 essential plant nutrients.  Within the plant, nutrients can be either mobile or non-mobile.  Nitrogen is a mobile plant element, being used in amino acid biosynthesis and essential to the chlorophyll molecule.  Magnesium is also a critical element in chlorophyll.  These both are mobile.  When the plant is lacking mobile nutrients, they take them from the older tissues and put them where they are needed.  

On the other hand, the non-mobile nutrients show signs in the new growth, as the plant cannot move these elements around.  Many elements become bound in cell membranes, and cannot be transported.

Many times when lots of leaf tips are burnt, this could also be a nutrient toxicity, too hot of fertilizer, or too much fertilizer.

It is always a good idea to consult a deficiency manual or guide to help diagnose a particular issue.  A lot of the time though, pH is the number one thing that is off that causes deficiencies.  Unfortunately, a lot of the time when you want an answer for a cause in plant sciences, you get a 'Well, it depends...' and it does, on many variables.

Hey everyone,

I recently read an article about the Boy Scouts of America's decision to allow gay men to be scout leaders and it got me thinking about the statistics behind it. According to research, gay men are actually less likely to commit sexual abuse than heterosexual men. This means that gay men should totally be allowed to be scout leaders.

I know that some people have religious and moral objections to this decision, but the facts are clear. Gay men are not a threat to the safety of scouts, and they should be allowed to participate in the organization.

What do you all think? Do you agree with the decision to allow gay men to be scout leaders?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/chicago with title ""So yeah, gay men, according to statistics, should totally be allowed to be scout leaders.""","I'm fairly certain I understood your point correctly: keeping gay men out of the BSA is doing nothing to protect the scouts since they're apparently still being molested. Therefore it's stupid to assume the gay men are the cause of the molestation. Please correct me if I am wrong. If I understand you correctly, I whole-heartedly agree.

I just want to add: I know it's not intuitive, but the majority of child molesters, even those who target boys, are not gay. (I say it's not intuitive because the boys are still male, not because I think all gay men like little boys. Sources disagree on why they target boys, but many experts agree its simply because of ease-of-access.)

I did a paper that included this subject in school and I read a few studies that all pretty much agreed that gay men are less likely to molest children than straight men. The numbers are about .5% to 2% of child molesters are homosexual, and while the numbers differ depending on who you ask, roughly 2% to 10% of Americans identify as gay. This means that your child is either less likely or just as likely to get diddled by a gay scout leader as he is a straight scout leader. But he is definitely not *more* likely to get molested by a gay scout leader.

Tl;dr: So yeah, gay men, according to statistics, should totally be allowed to be scout leaders."

Chicagoans,

As you may know, Illinois law requires scout leaders to be mandated reporters and to report any suspected child abuse or neglect to the authorities. This means that if a scout leader suspects that a child is being abused or neglected, they must report it to the proper authorities.

It is our responsibility as citizens of this great state to ensure that our children are safe and protected. If you have any information about a child who may be in danger, please do not hesitate to report it. Together, we can make sure that our children are kept safe and that those who are responsible for their care are held accountable.

Thank you for helping to keep our children safe.

Sincerely,

The Reddit Community of Chicago","give me the text of a reddit post from r/chicago with title ""By IL law scout leaders are mandated reporters and by law have to report any suspected child abuse or neglect to the authorities.""","Boy Scouts really fucked up.  That said, I believe that their biggest mistake was not training their leaders on mandated reporting in IL.

See my email below to my family members who are active scout leaders:

So, through my job and internship it has come to my attention that any recreational personnel that work with children are MANDATED REPORTERS.  Per the IL DCFS website at 
WHO ARE MANDATED REPORTERS?

Members of the general public may report suspected child abuse and neglect if they choose. However, state law mandates that workers in certain professions must make reports if they have reasonable cause to suspect abuse or neglect. Mandated reporters include:

Medical Personnel: Physicians, psychiatrists, surgeons, residents, interns, dentists, dentist hygienists, medical examiners, pathologists, osteopaths, coroners, Christian Science practitioners, chiropractors, podiatrists, registered and licensed practical nurses, emergency medical technicians, substance abuse treatment personnel, hospital administrators and other personnel involved in the examination, care or treatment of patients.
School and Child Care Personnel: Teachers, school personnel, educational advocates assigned to a child pursuant to the School Code, truant officers, directors and staff assistants of day care centers and nursery schools, and child care workers.
Law Enforcement: Truant officers, probation officers, law enforcement officers, and field personnel of the Department of Corrections.
State Agencies: Field personnel from the Departments of Children and Family Services, Public Health, Public Aid, Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities, Corrections, Human Rights, Rehabilitation Services. Also includes supervisors and administrators of general assistance under the Illinois Public Aid Code.
Others: Social workers, social service administrators, substance abuse treatment personnel, domestic violence program personnel, crisis line or hotline personnel, foster parents, homemakers, **recreational program or facility personnel**, registered psychologists and assistants working under the direct supervision of a psychologist, members of the clergy.
Mandated reporters who make good faith reports have the same immunity from liability under the law as non-mandated reporters. However, a mandated reporter's failure to report suspected instances of child abuse or neglect to DCFS constitutes a Class A misdemeanor; simply reporting suspicions to a superior does not satisfy legal requirements.

What does this mean?  It means that BY LAW you are required to report any suspected cases of child abuse or neglect. 

Why am I sending this out?  Because I am disturbed by how neither Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts has ever covered mandated reporting in their trainings, even though you are required to be mandated reporters by law.  Failure to do so could result in criminal charges and the state taking actions against the organization.  Boy Scouts is certainly in a lot of trouble for failing to report child abuse in the past (see the article 

According to the article: The Boy Scouts of America sent reporters a news release in which they say that under current policy, ""it is mandatory that any good-faith suspicion of abuse is immediately reported to law enforcement.""  However, I have yet to hear about ANY scout leader being trained on mandated reporting, so yeah.

This past summer, I had the unfortunate experience of having to deal with a 16 year old kid with the mindset of the Joker. On a scouting trip, he decided to take off all his clothes and wander around the campsite. He then proceeded to hump the leader of the troop, which caused the entire troop to crumble. 

It was a difficult situation to handle, as we had to make sure the kid was safe, while also ensuring the other kids weren't exposed to any inappropriate behavior. In the end, the kid was removed from the troop and sent home.

His personality is impossible to describe; sometimes he's hilarious, others obnoxious, and occasionally just insane. there are various things that got him into trouble on this trip, I'll just list a few. He spent half the trip naked, which any adult leader would know is a youth protection nightmare, but when you're 60+ miles from the nearest phone, vehicle, or access to the outside world, there's nothing the leaders can do about it when this kid has the attitude of the joker. He has no fear of consequences whatsoever whether it's losing brownie points or even legal consequences. He's extremely intelligent, very athletic, and a black belt in some form of kicking people's asses (I've seen him take on people much larger than him in person) and about 16 years old so there isn't much our victim (scrawny adult with the build of a 14 year old girl) could do at all to stop this kid. when the leader was away from the campsite, the kid ran into the tent naked and got in the leader's sleeping bag. on other occasions he would sexually harass the leader and even try dry humping him in front of everyone and thought it was funny. the leader tolerated this for the sake of the kids who had behaved themselves and wanted to finish the trip but he drew the line when he overheard our psycho trying to pressure another boy into comparing penises. Needless to say this kid was immediately kicked out of the troop and it pretty much destroyed us. we had an awesome troop with some amazing adult leaders that I still consider some of my greatest role models today. After these events, some of the best leaders we had left the troop for various reasons. the troop is now falling apart because of this crazy kid. We were unique in a good way. we followed our own moral compass which is why i thought we were much better than the standard boy scout troop. We encouraged people to challenge the rules when necessary (think outside the box and come up with our own way of solving problems) and the BSA hated us. It was wonderful. that's all gone now and it's just like a standard follow the book troop. And that's how crazy kid ruined Christmas!

I'm standing in the corner, watching the debate, and I can't help but think that everyone should always pick GI Joe. Why? Because apparently when you pick Cobra, you aren't worthy of cookies at snack time. 

So, if you want to get your hands on those delicious treats, always pick GI Joe. Trust me, it's worth it.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Civcraft with title ""Always pick GI Joe, cause apparently when you pick Cobra, you aren't worthy of cookies at snack time.""","Yes, but I feel in this case they are separate entities. Civcraft is a game. The game starts, and the game ends. The character dies, the player moves on. Everyone plays Civcraft for different reasons, but some people wish to learn. For me the most intelligent option was to choose a different character so I may experience a different reality within this game. A reality that happens to effect others in ways which they perceive as negative. So this ""victim"" of my actions, how do they choose to feel about me? Do they resent the character portrayed, or the person who chooses to portray them? Do they keep these resentments when the game ends and a new one begins? 

There is a risk factor that happens when you step into Civcraft, you're stepping into an experiment, you don't know whats going to happen. I personally feel that when I, or any one carries forth with an action some perceive to be negative, there is truly no harm being done. The only harm that any ""Real Person"" receives is that which he allows himself to receive, at least in CivCraft. 

This isn't really a clean issue though, right now I feel that most interaction taking place right now is between players, and not so much between characters. Especially when you hold a player accountable on the same level as the character for the actions of a character.

TL;DR Always pick GI Joe, cause apparently when you pick Cobra, you aren't worthy of cookies at snack time.  "

I'm in a league play human vs human in EA NHL and it's been a great experience so far. We have a policy to weed out people who disappear or don't show up to their games, which has been really helpful in keeping the league active and competitive. Most of the GMs in the league are really dedicated and take their games seriously, which makes for some great matches. 

If you're looking for a fun, competitive league to join, I would definitely recommend this one!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/EA_NHL with title ""we weed out people who disappear, most GMs in league play lots human vs human.""","The schedule is advanced by 2 weeks at a time. It is preferred that all games would be human vs human,  and I feel we achieve this more often than not.  
If any GM feels he won't be able to play all or any games in schedule period,  then it's requested you build your AI and set team to enable CPU.
  If anyone goes a schedule period without playing, a friendly reminder is sent. 
   If the team seems to be completely inactive for the next period ( 1 week real life) and no response to reminder, that GM will be removed,  but seat held for one schedule period if they wish to rejoin.
   Not a nazi about this tho,  exceptions have been made,  people have lives and shit happens.  
TL.DR: we weed out people who disappear, most GMs in league play lots human vs human.

It's been a long and emotional ride for the Islanders and their fans as they prepare to bid farewell to the Nassau Coliseum. After years of ups and downs, the Islanders will finally be making their move to Brooklyn.

Tonight marks the final game at the Coliseum and it's sure to be an emotional one. As the Islanders take the ice for the last time, it's hard to not feel a twinge of sadness for all the memories that have been made here.

I recently ran a game where I allowed my players to steal ideas from different noncommercial IPs. It was a great experience and I had a lot of fun with it. However, I did notice that the players almost certainly derailed the plot because of it.

So, if you're considering allowing your players to steal ideas from noncommercial IPs, just be aware that the players almost certainly will derail the plot. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's something to be aware of.

What has been your experience with allowing players to steal from noncommercial IPs?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/rpg with title ""There's nothing wrong with a little noncommercial IP theft, just be aware that the players almost certainly will derail the plot.""","As the saying goes, ""Good artists create, great artists steal.""

The only real problems are if anyone else has played the game before, and therefore knows what's going to happen, and if they decide to go off the rails.

Remember, the great strength of pen and paper RPGs is that they're freeform. Unfortunately, that's the exact opposite of the great strength of published stories, namely that they're completed.

Regular authors don't have to worry about one of their characters suddenly deciding to derail the plot, because they control everyone. You don't have that luxury.

What will you do if they decide to side with the bad guy? Will it be an insurmountable campaign-killer if they decide to refuse a job? What happens if they murder an important NPC?

You need to be prepared for the inevitable wrench in the works known as creative players. I know there's nothing they like more than confusing me and making me scramble to describe what happens when they do something I didn't think of.

tl;dr There's nothing wrong with a little noncommercial IP theft, just be aware that the players almost certainly will derail the plot."

I've been playing Pathfinder for a few months now, and I'm starting to get a bit of a handle on the rules. I'm still a bit of a noob, though, so I thought I'd come here and ramble a bit about my experiences with the game.

I'm playing a Half-Elf Rogue in a 3-player game, and it's been a lot of fun. I'm really enjoying the flexibility of the class, and the ability to do a lot of different things. I'm also really liking the tactical elements of the game, and the way it encourages you to think about your character and their capabilities in a different way than other RPGs.

Overall, I'm really enjoying Pathfinder, and I'm looking forward to learning more about the rules and the game. Thanks for reading my ramble!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Pathfinder_RPG with title ""ramble ramble ramble.""","If you're new to things, I would recommend running pre-written adventures to start with, so that you can get a feel for what you need to run a game and what you're comfortable improvising. One of the greatest strengths of Pathfinder is the excellent adventures that Paizo puts out, so I don't see any reason to skip out on them, especially if you're not comfortable yet.

Drawing maps, I mostly do by hand if it's actually necessary. Get a feel for the general layout of the region and sketch it out for your PCs. Keep a copy and scan it into your computer so you can reference it later. Add on to it as they explore, but don't too far beyond, say, a starting town and its immediate environs. For a starting group that's all they will need for a little while, if you set things up so that there are several adventure hooks in the region.

Thinking up the world is mostly theft. Find things you like from a bunch of different sources, then mix and match what fits together in interesting ways. My home setting is a mix of a bunch of different influences - Eberron, World of Warcraft, Song of Ice and Fire, Magic: The Gathering, even some Star Trek. I take things I like from other stuff, warp it so it's not quite as obvious, and then bam! I have an interesting setting element.

Running campaigns, to me, is about figuring out who opposes the PCs, what they want, and what resources they have to accomplish those goals. Plots flow from how the PCs muck up those plans and resources, and how those plots cause problems for other NPCs that might ask the PCs for help.

When should there be a fight? It depends on the group, of course, but once per session isn't a bad idea. I generally don't do more than that unless it's a fairly long or action-packed session (though it depends a lot on what kind of games you run - dungeon crawls will almost always have several fights, whereas investigation games with heavy roleplaying might not have that many).

It takes time to learn to read the mood of the group to figure out when they want action and when they want to relax into some longer roleplaying. Watch your players - are they fidgeting, looking at their phones, stacking dice? If so, up the action. Are they smiling, talking to each other in character, and having a good time interacting? Then don't interrupt them, or continue talking to them as whatever NPC you're playing at the moment. If one player is hogging the spotlight, try and find reasons to get other players involved, or move on to the next scene that involves someone else.

TL;DR ramble ramble ramble."

I've been playing Pokemon games since I was a kid and I've always had a group of friends who were also into it. We would all hack the games, play them a lot, and try to beat each other.

This is a difficult topic, and it's one that I see a lot of people struggling with. It's not easy to find someone who is compatible with you, and it's even harder to find someone who is willing to have sex with you. But, it is possible.

The first step is to go online and find a girl that matches you. This could mean using a dating site, or it could mean going out and meeting people in person. Either way, make sure you get to know the person before you start anything physical.

Once you've found someone who you think is compatible with you, it's time to own who you are. Don't try to be someone you're not, be honest about who you are, and be proud of it. This is the best way to show someone that you're confident and that you know what you want.

Once you've done that, it's time to impress the girl with your you-ness. Show her that you know who you are and that you're comfortable in your own skin. Show her that you're not afraid to be yourself, and that you're willing to take risks.

Once you've done all of that, it's time to have sex with her, if she wants to have sex with you. This is a very personal decision, and it should be respected. Make sure that you both feel comfortable and that you both trust each other.

In the end, it's all about finding someone who is compatible with you, owning who you are, and being confident in yourself. If you can do all of that, then you can find someone who is willing to have sex with you. Good luck!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/relationships with title ""Go online, find a girl that matches you, date that girl, own who you are, impress that girl with your you-ness, and then have sex with that girl, if she wants to have sex with you.""","I really get where you're coming from with wanting to date people you know well. Some people will tell you not to wait that long, but I know from personal experience you can't just change your methods like that.

That comment tells me you're more about the personality than the looks. Of course you want a cute girl, too, but a girl can become cute to you if she's interesting enough.

That's how it is for me, at least. If that doesn't apply to you read someone else's advice, instead, I guess.

What I'd recommend in that case is an online dating profile. Online dating is all about personality. You make a profile, answer some compatibility questions, and then see profiles that would be a good fit for you. You get to know girls before you even have to talk to them. And for the most part everyone on these sites is looking for dates so you both know what you're after. (Also, I personally really like OKCupid. There's lots of cool people on there and it's free. This has not been a paid endorsement haha.)

As for the virgin thing and the girlfriend dry spell, you can't think about it too much. You can't let it consume you and become desperate. Desperate is not sexy. You have to own who you are. Own it and be awesome about it. You don't have a girlfriend? You don't suck, you've just been waiting until you find a girl that is awesome enough for you. You're overweight? Fuck that, you're the right weight, everyone else is too damn skinny. And there are girls out there that go crazy for a little extra. Just ask my girlfriend. No matter who you are, what you like, what you look like, there are girls out there that want some of that. Find them.

This post is in response to an article from The Economist that discussed the progress made in South Africa since the end of apartheid.

It seems like the author of the article failed to recognize the fact that freedom means something different to South African blacks than it does to other people. To SA blacks, freedom isn't just about having the same rights as everyone else, it's about being able to take part in a society that has been historically oppressive. It's about being able to live without fear of discrimination and violence.

The Economist should have done a better job of informing readers about this important cultural perspective. It's not enough to just talk about the progress that has been made; we must also recognize the cultural context in which that progress has been made. Otherwise, we risk overlooking the struggles that SA blacks still face.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/worldevents with title ""To SA Blacks Freedom is not the same thing to you and me, and the Economist would certainly done well to inform the reader of this huge difference in culture perspective.""","Just came from a 3 week visit there.  A good read, thanks for sharing, OP.

For anyone reading, let it be known I am philosophically a fiscal conservative and the family member who hosted me is an active warden (sitting government official) of the DA party.

I found the article an interesting take in that it seems overly simplistic and even optimistic.  However, South Africa's natural resources and history in achievement (e.g., medicine, technology, etc.) is still keeping them afloat in the global market.

On the homefront it is decreasing and they do need to change.  The shift of power has led to an attitude of ""now that's ours"" and decades of decimating the wealth that did exist to the poor.  This, without a doubt is a great intention, but has come with two great costs -- corruption and economic destruction.

I was told how 10 white farms had been given to black families by the government which today these farms produce a tenth of what they used to.  I feel this is the best of all the examples I could share as how policy of good public intent has been implemented with long-term disaster for the public as whole.

Another example is how a visit to the local fire department where now there is mandate to have 40% of all fire fighters be women.  It is real struggle because even those women who do pass the physical fitness tests just desire a job and have no interest in a career in ""fire fighting.""  Upon acquiring the job the lieutenants are faced with resistance and the women complaining and even pleading with questions, ""why can't I just stay here and clean?  I don't want to fight fires.""  (their words, not mine).

The biggest areas the article isn't addressing is the vast corrumption in the government and the overwhelming culture of the Blacks now dominating the political landscape.  I sadly cannot tell you eloquently how powerful the latter is, but the culture **is not** capitalism but of socialism.  Not political mind you but culturally -- what is yours is mine too.  And as long as whites are perceived as whealthier, imo, then the culture will tend to simply blame whites and vote for the ANC -- a free card to be corrupt.

I will end with a story shared with me with my brother-in-law told me.  At the end of aparthied a man discovered 3 blacks looting a vehicle.  He, a the pasteur at the church where it was happening, tried to intervened but the men persisisted saying, ""having you heard we are free now!""

Confused, he insisted they elaborate and they finally got the message across to him that, ""by being free, now everything was free for them to take and have as their own now.""

TL;DR To SA Blacks Freedom is not the same thing to you and me, and the Economist would certainly done well to inform the reader of this huge difference in culture perspective.

2008 was my first time voting in a Presidential election, and I cast my vote for Barack Obama. This year, my vote is primarily a vote against Obama, rather than for Mitt Romney. However, there is one aspect of Romney that I do quite like: I think he will do much better at handling the economy. While I don't agree with all of his fiscal policies, I believe that his business acumen, combined with his experience in the private sector, will be beneficial for the nation's economy.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""2008 my vote was primarily a vote  for  Obama.

I believed that he would change the tone of government.  That he would involve ordinary citizens in the decision making process.  That there would be spirited discussions on new laws.

However, for the most part that hasn't happened.  Remember the new petition system?  That would have been a great start.  But it's obvious that Obama doesn't take is seriously.  I didn't expect him to change his positions based on a petition, but it would have been nice to see personalized, heartfelt explanations rather than the canned responses that we got.

Obama turned out to be just another politician.  As a result, I feel rather used.  If that was Obama's only fault, I might still vote for him again.  After all, that makes him no worse than any other politician.  

The more serious problem is that lack of accomplishments.  Gitmo is still open.  The economy is in a rut.  The new healthcare law is a mess.  Etc.  These problems aren't entirely Obama's fault, but he seems more interested in blaming his opponents than in fixing the problems.  Moreover, I don't buy the ""Republicans wouldn't cooperate with us"" excuse.  He had a super-majority in Congress for the first year he was in office.  That meant that the *Democrats didn't need a single Republican vote to pass a law*.  If Bush and Clinton and Reagan can get stuff done when their opponents control Congress, Obama should be able to get stuff done with a super-majority.


I'll be voting for Romney this year.  It was a hard decision, and I didn't support Romney until seeing him in the first debate.  Throughout the debates Romney came across as confident, intelligent, conciliatory, and knowledgeable; whereas Obama came across as petty, weak, and shallow.

Throughout the debates, I felt that Romney presented a plan and a vision (albeit an incomplete one).  Whereas Obama never presented his own plans and instead focused on finding holes in Romney's.  Moreover, the holes Obama found were shallow.  (Obama said something to the effect of ""The only Government spending Romney is going to cut is Planned Parenthood and Big Bird.""  That's a really disingenuous attack.) 

I have some concerns about Romney's views, but I agree with Scott Adams (of Dilbert fame) when he said that Romney is a pragmatic chameleon and will likely adapt his views to the situation at hand.  In other words, I don't think Romney is going to push hard-right social policies in a Senate that is split roughly 50/50.  

**TL;DR:** 2008 my vote was primarily a vote *for* Obama.  This year, my vote is primarily a vote *against* Obama, rather than for Romney.  However, there is one aspect of Romney that I do quite like:  I think Romney will do much better at handling the economy."

I'm a woman and I'm interested in MRA (Men's Rights Activism). I don't really understand it myself and I've never had a conversion moment, but I'm still interested in it.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who's interested in MRA but doesn't really get it. I'm curious to hear why other people are interested in it and how they got into it.

Thanks!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/LadyMRAs with title ""Not who you'd expect to be into MR, never have a conversion moment, don;t really understand it myself.""","Nothing happened in my life to bring me round. I've had a slow burn on a lot of different issues. Until I was 12 I genuinely believed that men should be treated like women were in Victorian times. after that, the more I got into politics and issues, the more I cared about all sorts of issues, like proper feminism, the environment, charities, wars, gender and sexuality etc. 

It's been increasingly creeping me out this last decade the growing distrust of men and the alarmist stuff about rape and pedophilia (the latter culminating when a (female) pediatrician in England was hounded from her house by a bunch of illiterate locals).

I have a father and a stepdad, neither of whom were much cop at being dads, and my mum always did the job enough for both of them, so I actually really have the archetypal angry feminist (I was also once in an abusive relationship with a man and was raped more than once - something I blame him for, not his gender).

The one area that does make sense is that I've never been very good at gender roles - I am female and while I object to all the unspoken rules about appearance and behavior that are pressed on me, I have always identified as female - but I've often followed the male unspoken rules without really realising it - buying little presents for my husband, being uncomfortable around children because of how it might look if I make eye contact, holding doors open and all that stuff. I'm baffled by this preferential treatment women supposedly get online - that idea that you prove you're a woman with a picture and suddenly a goddess or something, because in my experience putting a picture of myself in most places means I'll be ridiculed.

This was way longer than expected. TL;DR: Not who you'd expect to be into MR, never have a conversion moment, don;t really understand it myself."

Men are not predominantly to blame for the system that allows women to behave badly. This system is the result of a complex web of gender roles, societal expectations, and institutionalized sexism. 

Primary female lobby groups and public opinion have created a culture in which women are not held accountable for their behavior. Women are not expected to take responsibility for their actions, and are often given a pass when they do something wrong. This culture has been perpetuated by the media, which often portrays women as victims and men as aggressors. 

The reality is that men and women are both responsible for the systems that allow women to behave badly. Men must speak out against this system, and hold women accountable for their actions. We must also work to create a culture of respect and equality, one in which women are held to the same standards as men. Only then can we create a society in which everyone is treated equally.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/LadyMRAs with title ""Men are not predominantly to blame for the system that allows women to behave badly, because they cannot speak out against such a system because of primary female lobby groups and public opinion.""","I don't agree with your general assertion that men are more likely to support female entitlement, or legislation that makes such entitlement possible.  Sure men are more in power, but those men are not free to act in opposition to feminism, because they may lose their jobs, or not get voted for and so on.

My point about the math comment is two fold.  I am using that example to show that men in power are not free to oppose many forms of female entitlement, and therefore it is not predominantly men who support female entitlement.  People are also less likely to accuse women of misogyny, and so the women in power do have more of an ability to speak out against feminism.

TL:DR  Men are not predominantly to blame for the system that allows women to behave badly, because they cannot speak out against such a system because of primary female lobby groups and public opinion."

We've all seen it: two people arguing over something incredibly trivial, and it escalating to the point of physical violence. It's a sad sight, but even more tragic is when it ends in someone's death. 

No matter how trivial the argument may have been, death is never a good outcome. In such situations, it's important to remember that breaking up the fight or walking away doesn't make you a ""pansy-ass"". It takes courage and strength to step in and stop the fight, or to simply walk away. 

It's important to remember that no matter how minor an argument may be, it can still have deadly consequences. So before things get out of hand, take a step back and think about the potential consequences of the situation. 

Be the bigger person, and don't let a fight escalate to the point of tragedy.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/videos with title ""Fighting sometimes gets people killed over stupid shit. Death isn't normally a good thing for an individual. Breaking up a fiight or walking away doesn't make you a pansy-ass. 
 EDIT: Derped a word & fixed into paragraphs.""","Maybe the woman just didn't want to see shit get completely out of control? If I saw a guy on the ground getting slapped around and not showing any signs of fighting back I would've told Bruce to chill out too. For the sake of context, say all this mulletman did was run his mouth. Why care about it that much to kick his ass when he's already down? 

The anti-fight mentality is only for safety and doesn't make us pansy-asses. Not everyone has the same restraint that you might have. That other someone might just kill a man while seeing red without careful discretion of why. Nipping this behavior in the bud stops what could be an unnecessary issue (like death, or something, maybe. I dunno). I do commend your reasoning about getting someone to see the error of their ways, but your methods might not work out in your best interest one day. 

However, if you were protecting yourself from a physical assault, then you gotta do what you have to. Yet if some jackass is spitting shit, why bother? They probably wont change just because they got floored. Most assholes that like nothing more than to talk will just be pissed off that they got floored, but will never think as to WHY it happened. This isn't the wild west frontier anymore, and walking away from this situation would've best way to handle it. 

If people truly understood their own mortality, this ridiculous aggression wouldn't happen on either end. I hope you didn't take any offense to this, as none was intended. Also in the very least you can *understand* why fighting isn't *usually* the best answer, and that shouldn't make America a pansy-ass nation.

TLDR
**Fighting sometimes gets people killed over stupid shit. Death isn't normally a good thing for an individual. Breaking up a fiight or walking away doesn't make you a pansy-ass.**

This is a sad but true story about a scam that targeted ""highly educated"" Americans. It seems that those with higher education levels were more likely to fall for this scam because of their lack of knowledge about the financial system and their trust in the people running it. 

The scam was a Ponzi scheme that promised high returns on investments. It seemed too good to be true, and it was. The people running the scheme were able to take advantage of the trust of the ""highly educated"" Americans and scam them out of their money. 

It's a reminder that no matter how smart or educated you are, you should always be aware of potential scams and never trust someone blindly. It's also a reminder that no matter how smart you are, you can still be fooled.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/TrueReddit with title ""It was a scam that targeted ""highly educated"" Americans so it only makes sense that ""highly educated"" Americans fell for it.""","Highly educated Americans were sold the belief that their ""higher education"" would get them a well-paying job so that they would be able to pay off the debt. When that didn't materialize it only makes sense that there would be a higher percentage of them with debt. It's not like banks were lending money and giving mortgages to impoverished people. They were targeting recent graduates and convincing them that the American Dream is to own their own home. And once you own that home you as well make that loan a bit bigger so that you can properly furnish the house.

tl;dr It was a scam that targeted ""highly educated"" Americans so it only makes sense that ""highly educated"" Americans fell for it. "

As a long-time fan of the Halo series, I have to admit that the books and games don't really match up. With the release of Halo Reach, it's become even more obvious that the books and games don't line up. While they may have some similarities, the games and books have taken different paths and tell different stories. It's not an easy answer as to which one is the ""true"" story; both are valid interpretations of the Halo universe.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/halo with title ""no easy answer, books and reach don't really match up.""","i think that was one of the main issues of contention about reach and how it didn't sync up at all with ""first strike"" and ""ghosts of onyx."" something i was kind of bummed about be cause both of those are tremendous books, with gox being one of my favorites.

It's true that there are people who are uneducated, ignorant, and stereotypical on both sides of the fence, but it's important to remember that it's not just an American problem. There are people all around the world who don't think about other humans and act on their own selfish desires. It's easy to point the finger at the United States and blame them for everything, but it's important to remember that we are all responsible for our own actions. Islam teaches us to be kind and compassionate to others, no matter their race, religion, or nationality. We must strive to be better and to treat others with respect and understanding.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/islam with title ""uneducated/ignorant/stereotypical people who don't think about other humans, exist on both sides of the fence but you are looking only at the Americans side.""","Yes it's noticeable, but here are my two cents:

1. Many people are brainwashed by media and don't want to admit it. You do this experiment yourself, try reading news from one biased source all the time, try it for 2-3 months in row and see how your views will start to change. Now think about those people who have been hearing the same biased media their whole life.

2. Honestly, we (Muslims) aren't much better. Example, there are many clips on youtube now for the Sandy storm, Arabic comments are full of hate and wish all Americans die in the storm, not all comments but most of them though. This isn't what Islam teaches us.


TL;DR: uneducated/ignorant/stereotypical people who don't think about other humans, exist on both sides of the fence but you are looking only at the Americans side."

He's a phony! A big, fat phony! I was so excited when I heard about the new Zelda game, but after playing it I realized it was nothing like the classic Zelda games I used to love. The graphics were terrible, the controls were clunky, and the story was shallow. It felt like a cheap knock-off of the real thing. I'm disappointed and I'm not sure if I'll ever try another Zelda game again.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/truezelda with title ""He's a phony! A big, fat phony!](""","That dude didn't beat the Running Man. That dude edited the text of the ROM to make it look like he did.

This method is simply fake, and you don't have to take my word for it. You can download [a v1.0 ROM of Zelda 64]( download [a hex editor]( and run a CTRL+F search for the text string ""speechless."" You'll find nothing. [Neither was this changed for later versions of OoT]( It's not in the hex, it's not in the text, and so it's not in the game.

Even were we to make an excuse such as that unlike the rest of the game text this text is encrypted, it would still fall flat because the byte in which the race seconds are stored is unsigned. It can't hold a negative value. That's probably why the Running Man abandons the race after the 4 minute mark — because 4 minutes is a rounded down 4:15, 4:15 corresponds to (4 * 60 + 15) = (240 + 15) = 255, and 255 is the maximum capacity of an unsigned byte. After 4:15, the seconds value rolls back over to 0.

For a more linguistic and less computational analysis, RustySporks further edits in the text, ""Farewell, then!"" yet the localization staff for OoT seem to consistently translate farewells as ""good-bye[s]."" You see this in these quotes:

* ""Good-bye... Great Deku Tree...""
* ""I can't wait to say good-bye to this place! Two of my buddies are still being held prisoner.""
* ""Just train harder. Good-bye, then!""
* ""Huff...huff... Good-bye, then!""
* ""Link... Good-bye....""
* ""It will be time for us to say good-bye...""
* ""That's an unpleasant mask... Good-bye.""

""Farewell"" doesn't appear at all within the OoT script and, what is more, in the real game the Running Man himself says, ""Good-bye, then!"" Even notwithstanding the ROM-based proof, it'd be strange indeed for Nintendo to change his ""Good-bye, then!"" into a ""Farewell, then!"" when ""good-bye"" is the standard parting remark. The OoT localization team translated five different goodbyes into ""good-bye,"" including the following:

* ""さよなら"" (hiragana ""sayonara"")
* ""さようなら"" (hiragana ""sayōnara"" or ""sayounara"")
* ""サヨナラ"" (katakana ""sayonara"")
* ""さらば"" (hiragana ""saraba"")
* ""別れ"" (kanji and hiragana ""wakare"")

This is the method he wrote that he claims leads to the outcome shown in his video:

* *1) Challenge the running man to a race as older Link.*

* *2) Return back 7 years and become younger Link.*

* *3) Wait at the bridge for nearly 7 IN-GAME years (about 1 week in real life [...]).*

* *4) ???*

* *5) Profit.*

This might not even be serious for two reasons. First, the ""???, Profit"" meme is oft-used lingo in the lexicon of trolls and the sarcastic. Second, the third step sounds like one of those silly requirements you'd read in a ""How to Get the Triforce"" rumor on a late 90s Angelfire / Geocities Web page. That he sets the bar for this step so unreasonably high indicates to me that he wants to either 1) see how many people will waste their time or 2) attack falsifiability and hypothesis testing from the angle of personal motivation.

Step 3 is further flawed since later he defines in-game time where ""[o]ne in-game day from dawn to the next dawn is 4 minutes,"" yet claims you should ""[w]ait at the bridge"" connecting Kokiri Forest to Hyrule Field. You can feel free to wait there until the cows come home, but no in-game time passes at the bridge.

Even if we ignore the particular method in the video and maintain the Running Man is defeatable, numerous people have hacked the game, either through the GameShark cheat device, MIPS assembly, RAM editors, emulator tools, or other means. They've changed the times, they've run the race, and they've still been outpaced by the Running Man. [Here]( is an example of me being beaten by the Running Man after hacking the game to finish the race in 0 seconds.

In the second video, he just fades out to the bombable grotto in the Sacred Forest Meadow, an area you can access in unglitched OoT gameplay. The area beneath the Zora's Domain ice sheet doesn't even lead there anyway, as you can see in [this YouTube video]( where YouTuber [TheJoeKid17]( swims up against the wall in question. Even if it was a beta room (it's not), the title would still be sensationalist nonsense as the video is not that of a Sky Temple.

The reason RustySporks' video comments seem to be a mass consensus of lemmings riding a bandwagon into the echo chamber of confirmation is because 1) most YouTubers have tubers for brains and 2) the comments on his video are enqueued until he approves them. He thus only lets through those who agree with him.

Verizon is one of the biggest telecom companies in the world, but they don't have the best reputation when it comes to customer service. They have been known to have terrible customer service, high prices, and poor network coverage. Despite all this, they still have a large customer base in Orlando. 

I have personally had terrible experiences with Verizon, and I have heard similar stories from many others. They are not a company I would ever recommend to anyone. So while they may not be left out in the cold based on technology, I still think they should be avoided.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/orlando with title ""Verizon isn't going to be left out in the cold based on technology, but screw them anyway, they're a terrible company.""","According to [what they've said]( Verizon plans on integrating VoLTE(Voice over LTE) beginning next year, so that will remove the requirement for manufacturers to support both CDMA and LTE in one phone if they want to make a phone that will work with Verizon. Because of this, I don't think that Verizon's going to be shut out, especially considering their size and clout with manufacturers.

Despite this, I still wouldn't recommend Verizon. They might have the largest network, but their policies are incredibly anti-consumer. After being a Verizon customer for 11 years, I'll be dropping them to get a Nexus phone once my contract is up. My last two phones have been smartphones, and they've both been crippled at Verizon's request. The first was the HTC Vogue (XV6900 on Verizon), which had its GPS chip locked down so that only Verizon-signed apps could access it (read: VZ Navigator). Fortunately the community was able to get around it and I was able to run Google Maps on their, but not well. My current phone is a Droid X, which had its bootloader locked down to prevent the user from running custom versions of Android. That wouldn't be a huge deal if not for the fact that the stock software on it is terrible and Verizon loads their phones with garbage. On top of all this, Verizon has made it so updates take forever to their Nexus device (Galaxy Nexus) and has forced Google to block Google Wallet from being installed on the GNex. Verizon shows a clear history of decisions that actively work against the consumer's interest and are entirely greed motivated.

tl;dr Verizon isn't going to be left out in the cold based on technology, but screw them anyway, they're a terrible company."

Hey everyone,

On the other hand, thursday night is NBC's classic big ""night"" (ER, Friends, and Seinfeld were all on NBC thursday nights at one time or another).  Recently, however, it hasn't been doing too well (I blame the fact that NBC keeps moving their shows around) and NBC has stated that for at least the first half of this season, they're focusing their marketing on strong Monday-Wednesday numbers.  On top of that mess, Big Bang Theory (heavy hitter from CBS, brings in great ratings*) is on at 8PM on Thursday nights as well.  Community has gone up against BBT before and come out looking pretty good compared to other NBC comedies but not so great overall.  

In a perfect world, NBC would have gone back to their old stack of 30 Rock, Community, The Office, and Parks and Rec at the beginning of this season.  That was winner of a lineup back in the day. Sadly they didn't and 30 Rock is ending in December.

I think the best lineup we can hope for is NBC throwing The Office, Parks and Rec, and Up All Night (*shudders*) just after Community and with any luck rope in some new fans and greater numbers from people tuning in early.

We all know that Gamefreak can do some weird things when it comes to Pokemon. From the introduction of Mega Evolutions to the introduction of Z-Moves, Gamefreak has always had a way of keeping the game fresh and exciting. And now, we're getting remakes of Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire, which is proof that Gamefreak can do some really weird things and still keep the game safe and enjoyable for players. It's exciting to think about what new features we could see in the remakes, and I'm sure we'll all be pleasantly surprised when the games come out.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/pokemon with title ""We're getting RSE remakes because Gamefreak can do weird things safely because Pokemon.""","Everyone always brings up the ""the remakes only happened so you could complete the pokedex"" crap argument, but if you had XD: Gale of Darkness and Emerald, you could complete the National Dex. Because you can move those Pokemon up into Gen IV, the HGSS games where pointless under that line of logic. Hell, FRLG was pointless in that case.

The Pokemon series is one of the most signifigant in all of gaming. Not bragging, just reporting. The fact that the games get updated versions after a year (y'know, Blue, Crystal, Emerald, Plat) is a good system because it helps keep the games alive in the long run with the short amount of post-release hindsight. The fact that Black and White didn't get their third version, in my mind, suggests that Gamefreak, if they do make remakes into a fixed tradition, is replacing third versions with remakes. 

I think it's a better move on their part. You have a *lot* more hindsight and you know just how the game aged and can go back and tweak the things that age like milk. Remakes are just better third versions. 

Gaming is very young, and this release system seems very weird because there really is only one release system for games that is widely adopted right now: releasing the game, possibly on several platforms, and then aside from DLC, being done with it. Pokemon already invented the whole dual version thing. I like the fact that Gamefreak is trailblazing. Pokemon has the freedom to try and do weird stuff in the non-game because even if it's the worst idea in the world, the constant refinement of the core Pokemon gameplay makes up for it and more.

**tl;dr:** We're getting RSE remakes because Gamefreak can do weird things safely because Pokemon."

Australia has long been a leader in refugee resettlement, taking in 80,000 refugees a year on a permanent basis. This is a remarkable achievement, especially when compared to other countries. 

Unfortunately, many of these refugees come from refugee camps, which are often overcrowded and lack basic amenities. It is a testament to the compassion of the Australian people that they are willing to take in such large numbers of refugees. 

However, the worst choice for refugees is to risk their lives on boats, as many have done in the past. The risk of death in a boat accident is too great, and other countries should strive to do more to provide safe and secure resettlement for refugees. 

Australia is setting an example that other countries should follow. We should all be doing our part to ensure that refugees are given the chance to rebuild their lives in safety.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/australia with title ""Australia does a good job permanently resettling 80,000 refugees a year (mostly from refugee camps, boat people are the worst choice because of the risk they die in a boat accident).

Boat people have made a choice. Go to a refugee camp (crappy choice), stay home and risk getting shot (crappy and dangerous choice), go on a boat to Australia (less crappy but dangerous and expensive choice).

If they go to a refugee camp, there's a good chance they will end up in a country that treats refugees like shit. Australia puts refugees (once they are processed) on a path to PR and citizenship, so they are almost as well-off as citizens. Places like Germany will treat them as second-class people indefinitely, unless they get deported.

If we want to really help people, we should accept more refugees from refugee camps (we do pretty well at this) or make refugee camps better. We could also push for better treatment of resettled refugees in other countries. 

Permanent resettlement is not seen as an option by many countries. ""You can come here for a few years, but should go home once you're no longer in danger"". Many countries say it's better off if refugees just wait for the war to end, so they can go home. It's bullshit, and inhumane, but many countries take that stance. That's what we should be fighting, because Australia (and the other countries which treat resettled refugees like real people) can't fix all the worlds problems.

tl;dr - Australia does a good job permanently resettling 80,000 refugees a year (mostly from refugee camps, boat people are the worst choice because of the risk they die in a boat accident). Other countries should step up their game. "

Hey everyone, 

I'm sure many of you have been in the same position as me: wanting to find someone special to settle down with, but not knowing where to start. Well, I'm here to tell you that the best way to find the right person is to date around. Don't be afraid to go on dates with different people and explore different relationships. You never know who you might find, and you never know what kind of connection you might make. 

So don't be afraid to date around and take your time. You don't have to settle down with the first person you meet. Keep your options open and explore different relationships. Who knows, you might just find the one you want to settle down with! 

Good luck everyone!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/dating_advice with title ""Date as many people as you want till you find the one you want to settle down with.""","It is okay to date multiple guys at a time, absolutely. I'm 28 and male. I date regularly. I'm cycling through women pretty much constantly. I'm not a player. I'm actually seeking a relationship. I just haven't found the right girl. Until the girl I'm dating and I sit down and decide that we want to exclusively date each other and evolve our dating into a relationship boyfriend/girlfriend thing I will date as many people as I feel like. This being said I generally know after about 4-6 dates whether it is going to work or not, so I'm not exactly leading them on either. 

tl;dr: Date as many people as you want till you find the one you want to settle down with. "

Hi everyone!

I'm a real estate salesperson and I wanted to share some advice for anyone looking to get into the industry.

First and foremost, if you're serious about getting into real estate, you should have a savings of at least $10 000 in case you struggle in your first year. This will give you a cushion in case you don't make as much money as you'd like in the beginning.

Second, make sure you study a lot and stay educated. The real estate industry is constantly changing and you need to stay ahead of the game.

Third, work hard. It's not easy to be successful in real estate, but if you put in the effort, you can make it.

Finally, don't be afraid to grab the bull by the horns. Nothing extraordinary in life happens by people who play it safe. Take risks and make moves to get ahead.

I hope this advice helps anyone looking to get into real estate. Good luck!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/IAmA with title ""If you are really serious about getting in real estate as a salesperson, have a savings of at least $10 000 in case you struggle in your first year. Study a lot, stay educated and work hard and you'll do just fine. And don't be afraid to grab the bull by the horns, nothing extraordinary in life happened by people who played it safe.""","I'm just about to register for my license in Real Estate. If you are really considering this jump the first thing you need to do is not to quit your 9-5 immediately, at least not until you have some sort of savings. This business isn't as many would like to think where you jump in, get your license and start selling or representing buyers, it's a serious game to be playing. Most people end up quitting within 2 years because they can't handle the attention this profession deserves or because they just can't make any sales.

Depending on your location you could be spending upwards of $3000 for registration and insurance after spending money going through the phases (classes) in preregistration, and $1500 or more on brokerage fees depending which one you pick to work for. And keep in mind you may not make any sales within your first few months working, maybe you won't make your first sale until after 6 months. So before registering think about saving $10 000 so you have something to live on in case you make no sales and earn 0 commission. It also helps to be living at home with your parents (i.e no rent), if you're young this shouldn't be a problem.

This business can be very rewarding, despite the hardships and struggles one might face in the beginning, but it's good. The level of success you achieve in this business is only limited to how much you work which means the economic pay offs can be limitless as long as you study a lot and work hard. The more you learn about this business the more fascinating it becomes and the wider your eyes get to the opportunities waiting for you. The key thing is to learn as much as you can, stay educated and work hard.

TL;DR: If you are really serious about getting in real estate as a salesperson, have a savings of at least $10 000 in case you struggle in your first year. Study a lot, stay educated and work hard and you'll do just fine. And don't be afraid to grab the bull by the horns, nothing extraordinary in life happened by people who played it safe."

Hello Reddit! I'm Kevin, and I'm here to tell you why I'm a douche.

It's because I get paid to be one. I'm an actor and I specialize in playing douchey characters. It's my job to act like a jerk and make people laugh. It's actually a lot of fun and I'm really good at it.

Hey everyone!

I'm here to share a lesson I learned the hard way - never assume someone's cool with a nickname.

When I was in high school, I had a friend who I thought was really cool and I wanted to give them a nickname. I thought it was funny and clever, but it turns out they didn't like it at all. They felt like I was belittling them with the nickname, and it caused a lot of tension between us.

It was a tough lesson to learn, but it taught me to never assume that someone is okay with a nickname. It's always better to ask first and make sure they're comfortable with it.

Thanks for reading. :)","give me the text of a reddit post from r/IAmA with title ""never assume someone's cool with a nickname. ;)""","Nah, seems like a good reason to me. You're asking these people for money, you show them respect. These are businessmen, not your buddy yet.

Yes you can do that with an Arduino! 

Arduino is a powerful and versatile tool that can be used to do a lot of different things. From controlling robots to making music, Arduino can do it all.

The data sheets for each of the products can be seen on the product's page towards the bottom, as well as listing the pin capabilities.  I'd also just download the software, it's free:   .  There are tons of examples to look at that come packaged with the software, including examples for 802.11, ethernet, zigbee, servos and solenoids as well as others.  OK, so you want to buy one now?

Freya Black-Steel is a Nord woman born in Morrowind, but her ancestors hail from The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. She traveled to Skyrim in search of knowledge, to learn more about the history and culture of the land and to hone her skills in combat.

 Freya Black-Steel is a Nord woman, born in Morrowind. Her ancestor, Wulfgar Black-Steel, was exiled to Morrowind, and later discovered he was the Nerevarine.

 After dealing with Dagoth Ur, he settled down, and started a family with a Dunmer huntress. Years passed, and the Black-Steel clan, now composed of both Nords and Dunmers, became one of the most wealthy and influential families in Morrowind, but they lost it all when the Red Mountain erupted, and moved to Solstheim. 

 Freya's father, a Dunmer blacksmith, taught her the arts of smithing, and her mother, a Nord warrior, taught her how to use an ax, but Freya's real passion was reading. Freya loved books, and was especially fascinated with the history of Skyrim. When she reached adulthood, she traveled to Skyrim, to explore and learn about her homeland, and to hone her warrior skills. 

One little detail about her: everyone knows how... promiscuous... are the Dunmer ladies, and being born and raised among them influenced Freya a lot. She's very promiscuous, and she has a thing for Dunmers.



 I used the [Live Another Life]( mod, so I could make her get to Skyrim by ship. Her main skill are Light Armor, Smithing, Enchanting, One-Handed and Two-Handed. She only uses War Axes and Battleaxes, and never uses a shield. She's also fascinated with magic, but never could learn more than basic spells (Flames and Healing), but she is a talented enchanter. 

Since her family has a mix of Nords and Dunmers, she has characteristics of both. Her skin is slightly grey, her eyes are red, and she has a small resistance to fire. 

TL;DR: Freya Black-Steel is a Nord woman, born in Morrowind, her ancestor is my character from TES III. She traveled to Skyrim to learn its history and culture, and to train her fighting skills. She uses axes and light armor, and is a talented enchanter."

Giving one player the absolute most fun possible isn't the design goal for good game designers.

Good game designers strive to create a game that is enjoyable for all players, even if that means that the individual's experience may not be the most exciting. The goal is to create a game that is balanced, fair and engaging for everyone. A good game designer will take into account the different playstyles and skill levels of all players, and create a game that is enjoyable for all.

A game that caters to one individual's needs may not be as enjoyable for the rest of the players, so a game designer must take into account the whole player base. This means creating a game that offers a variety of challenges, rewards and strategies that appeal to different types of players.

Ultimately, a good game designer will create a game that is fun and engaging for everyone, rather than just one player.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/leagueoflegends with title ""Giving one player the absolute most fun possible isn't the design goal for good game designers.""","You sound like you need to read this:

""Not fun isn't the same as anti-fun - it's an interesting distinction actually.

Think of it in positive, negative and zero terms. Fun is clearly positive. Not fun is Zero. Anti-fun is negative on that scale. Skills that fail the fun vs. anti-fun test is when one player's fun isn't really counterbalanced by the negative on the other player - And the important thing is this isn't zero-sum, suprisingly.

The subjectivity of this comes where you set your zero-point for things.

However, there are lots of things that simply aren't fun from a player perspective that is negative fun for the opponent - If for example, I made a button that lets you physically beat someone with a chair on the other side of the screen - that's not enjoyable for me - and it's very very negative for you. That's an example of a non zero-sum scenario.

As to the concern that 'anti-fun principles are hindering creativity' - well.. I'm not sure about that - you may want to ask yourself whether or not creative uniqueness is a priority for designs or not - Solid gameplay, for example, is a great goal to strive for, even if it's unoriginal.

Even though I tinker with crazy stuff all the time, I would always trade something that is solid to play rather than original/unique and mediocre.""


""*Do you not understand that the people doing the stunlocking and bursting are also having fun?*

That statement kind of leads to the thought that having an infinite combo in a game is good design because it supposedly lets one player have an infinite amount of gratification.

Again, the measure is fun vs. anti-fun a lot of the time - Anivia's wall creates many more awesome moments than bad ones for your team - It's about ratios - And like I said before, it's a subjective point on where your zero point is.

Anti-fun is typically embodied by lock-down, shut down, or obscure-counter mechanics - They almost universally restrict and control the opponent's range of options - leading to less play overall simply because your opponent reacts less. Yes, while there will always be people who find pleasure in fighting helpless opponents who simply sit there and do *nothing* at all (see above, for the infinite case), I don't think this is gameplay we should encourage.

*Chair-Beating*

You're telling me that you would willingly play a game, where every so often, the opponent gets to beat you senseless with a chair? That's kind of a scary thought.""

Go fuck yourself. Life is too short to waste time on people who don't appreciate you. Move on and find people who do. Life is too short to stay stuck in the same place. Take a chance and explore the world. Don't let anyone hold you back.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/lostgeneration with title ""Go fuck yourself.""","You're probably a troll, but whatever. I'll bite. 

&gt;Ya!! Since we went to college we should just be handed jobs and money. It's fucked up that the economy is bad right now and we will have to work through hard times to make things work in the end. It's just fucked up, not fair for us. Just not fair!

First of all, our generation isn't the one that fucked up the economy or created the ""college = job"" system, or drove up tuition, or created the student loan system. But we *are* the ones who are stuck dealing with it. Sorry if we want to vent just a little. 

Second, most of the people that I know don't expect to ""be handed jobs and money."" (And those that do - well, we didn't teach ourselves to expect that, did we?) I realize that's anecdotal and a gross generalization, but whatever. Most of us are actually willing to work hard and work our way up. Most of us just want a decent job that has reasonable benefits and pays fairly. Most of us don't want success handed to us, we just want the *opportunity* to be successful. But fuck us, right? 

I mean, for myself I just want a decent apartment in a safe area of town - nothing fancy, nothing huge, just something comfortable. I want a job with decent benefits so that if I get sick I can get treated instead of having to hope that it goes away. I want an income that covers my bills and taxes, with enough left over for some savings, and also for the occasional entertainment. Not a $200+ bar tab every weekend. I just don't want to feel guilty or worried when I go out for dinner and/or drinks with my friends on occasion. In other words, I just want a decent standard of living; I don't think that's an unreasonable expectation.  

The problem is, those first couple *minor* things - you know, decent housing, health insurance, *bills* - have gotten so retardedly expensive that it's hard to meet them with a single income, especially when you're a recent grad working at some shitty starter job (if you're lucky enough to be employed). So yeah, we're asking for, hoping for, larger salaries because we need the money just to get up to that decent standard of living. That's hardly our fault. 

&gt;Instead of doing anything to better myself or the economy I'm just going to sit around and bitch and wait for someone else to fix things. 

What are we supposed to do? Most of us are probably going to vote, but that's not really going to fix much regardless of which parties win. Those of us who have found jobs are working. Those of us who are unemployed are trying to find work. We're trying to work our way up. We're trying to be consumers. We're trying to pay our debts. But it's damn hard at the moment. 

&gt;That way when it's all better I can get a cozy desk job to pay the bills with my college degree.

What's wrong with a ""cozy desk job""? Not all of us want to be superstar rich uberprofessionals. Like I said above, most of us just want decent jobs that pay the bills and let us live. 

My dad is a health care professional (not a doctor). He's excellent at his job - he has the highest patient satisfaction rating in his department. Yet he constantly gets in trouble with his supervisors for not having his paperwork done. Not because he's lazy - it's because he doesn't have time. Between actually treating patients, waiting for late patients to show up, making phone calls, dealing with prescriptions, helping coworkers, dealing with miscellaneous issues, and then actually trying to keep with the stupidly huge amounts of paperwork that health care demands (ever trying billing Medicare?) he winds up working a 16+ hour day on an eight-hour salary. It's destroyed his health, his ability to enjoy his job, and my parents' marriage. Meanwhile his supervisors sit in their offices working on useless advanced degrees. They don't offer any support. Hell, they probably don't even know how to treat a patient. All they do is send out bullshit emails about ""professionalism"" and ""integrity"" and ""it's a team effort"" and ""we need more productivity."" Meanwhile my dad and his coworkers have all had to get remote access credentials so that they can work from home at night. And the supervisors continue to demand more. 

So yeah, I'm okay with a ""cozy desk job."" Maybe that makes me lazy, but I really don't care. I come in at 8. I leave at 5. I'm willing to work damn hard while I'm there, but when it's 5 I'm gone and my work stays on my desk. It's just a job, a thing I do for money. I'm not going to make myself a slave just to please somebody else, based on the ephemeral promise of intangible rewards.

I recently went on a solo trip to a Middle East country, and I decided to hitchhike from one city to the next. I got into a car with an older male driver who seemed nice enough at first, but he kept getting more and more inappropriate. He kept touching my knee, and he kept making lewd comments about my body.

What did you do?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""Single female hitchhiked in Middle East country; came across horny, ignorant male driver who kept touching her knee.""","This story's pretty anticlimactic, thankfully. 
When I was living in Lebanon (I was 20, this was in '09), I hitchhiked from northern Lebanon to Beirut (about an hour and a half-ish) at night because I had missed all the buses and I really needed a ride.

I'm a single, Asian female and I'm in a skirt on the side of the highway. I stand out quite a bit. Looking back, I think most people thought I was a prostitute because a lot of cars stopped a few feet away from me and when I wouldn't approach them, they sped off.

Long story short, this really non-threatening looking guy pulls up in a small red car. I think it was roughly 8 or 9 pm. My Arabic isn't terribly good and he barely speaks English. Everything's going along just fine. He asks me about where I'm from and what I'm doing in Lebanon. Very basic. Then he asks me if I have any male friends in Lebanon (words are gendered). I'm kind of confused but I say that yes, I have lots of male friends, not only in Lebanon.

A few more minutes into the trip and he suddenly touches my exposed knee. I freak out and ask him what he's doing. He apologizes and we sit in awkward silence. 

Ten minutes later, he does it again.

I freak out and call my guy friend in Beirut who speaks Arabic and I'm telling him what happened. He speaks to the guy driving me and basically explains to him in Arabic the situation. My friend then tells me that the guy giving me a ride seems to be an absolute idiot.

Thankfully, nothing bad happened. I was able to make it to my destination without any more issues. Though looking back, this could've easily gone REALLY bad REALLY easily.

It's amazing how often I see people try to push their conspiracy theories on this sub without doing even the most basic research to see if their story has any facts to back it up. 

I recently saw a post that claimed that a certain company was owned by Monsanto, but the poster hadn't even bothered to check if the people they listed actually worked for Monsanto. 

It's disappointing when people don't take the time to make sure their stories are accurate, especially when they've put so much effort into making sure their post looks nice and their profile looks credible. 

If you're going to post here, please take the time to do a little research to make sure your story is accurate. It'll save you a lot of embarrassment in the long run.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/conspiratard with title ""You might want to actually take two seconds and check to see at least if your story has  some  facts before trying to bait a bunch of Skeptics.

That's right, ""Monsanto Employees"" (ROFL), he's adding people as moderators and approved submitters to those that ""applied"". My theory is this kid was hoping that a bunch of us would jump on this (because we're obviously shills) then he could screenshot the usernames of the approved submitters and moderators as ""proof"" we're all paid shills. 

BTW, really nicely done boys, [the style sheet looks excellent]( I especially like the attention to detail on the moderators: 



Really great. Now in one of the screenshots there was a whole thread of ""HR contacts"" and other important contacts. All pretty much using the same phone number. Which I thought was odd. For a couple of different reasons: 

1. Monsanto would have to fill out your W2s. You would already have a contact number of HR 

2. Even Evil Monsanto is going to do a background check before hiring. They are going to want to make sure they are not hiring fellons. 

3. All the numbers lead to one VOIP line. Why would Monsanto HR being using a Skype number? Wouldn't they just use many of the freely available lines at their corporate headquarters, or maybe actually use the corporate headquarters HR phone number:  ?

Now I will applaude you for removing any personal identifying information from Google tied to the main number you listed, you even removed your name from your Amazon store. You really made sure that if anyone googled the phone number you had listed in the forum there, that no-one would be able to find anything through Google that tied back to your real name. 

So sad. 

Here's the issue, you didn't think to check Bing. And your name is definitely *not* Rick. It rhymes with ""Noahs Ark"" ;-) and you appear to be in High School. Oh, and you enjoy soccer. 

Now, that's not the only problem. Your other problem is you didn't take two seconds to google who's *actually* in charge of Monsanto's social media. I do like how you went Jews all the way down, all the names are jews (LOL). However, a quick trip to google reveals that the Director of Social Media is not a Jewish man, but an blond Italian looking middle-aged woman:  you didn't even get the sex right (ROFL).  BTW, the actual head Monsanto's ""Internet Relations"" is not a Jewish woman, it's actually this guy:  (ROFL X 2!). 

That's who's *actually* in charge. In fact, searching LinkedIN (which 99% of professionals now-a-days have a LinkedIn profile) finds no reference to a ""Rick Bergmann"" working for Mansanto anywhere. In fact **none** of the people you have listed, actually seem to work for Mansanto. 

Also, feel free to search LinkedIn, but there's not one social media personal named ""Rick Bergmann"" in social media listed on LinkedIn. This scenario is highly unlikely. Considering most people hired to be a Social Media Director, have profiles everywhere.

My cousin and I had been working the same boring job for years. We were both unfulfilled and looking for something new and exciting. But when he finally quit, it was surprisingly bittersweet. I got nostalgic for the days when we would crack jokes and make the most of our mundane tasks.

So whenever the machines didn't run, we would sweep the floors and I remember cleaning the cracks on the floor, while talking to him, or having lunch outside in the other huge manufacturing floor.
One day he stops getting hours and for two weeks, he doesn't work. He finds a job and quits.

Despite its usefulness, boxed wine has a stigma that vineyards/companies won't invest in to break. Boxed wine has been seen as a cheap option for those who can't afford the more expensive bottled wines. But with the rise of craft wines, more and more people are turning to boxed wine as a way to enjoy a quality wine without breaking the bank. So why aren't vineyards and companies investing in the boxed wine market? Perhaps it's because the stigma still exists, and they don't want to be associated with it. But if they did invest in the boxed wine market, they could make a great product that people would be willing to pay for, and break the stigma once and for all.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/shutupandtakemymoney with title ""Despite it's usefulness, boxed wine has a stigma that vineyards/companies won't invest in to break.""","This is a current issue that may see no end (also closures such as corks/fake corks/[zorks]( 

**First some background:**

""High end"" wine, which is defined by anything over $25 strangely enough, will almost never be in a box. The biggest reasoning is that some gas exchange is good. A well made bottle of wine (of the right varietals) needs a good cork to cellar and age. When stored properly the cork will allow a very minute amount of gases to go back and forth. This aids in the chemical changes that take place in a good bottle over time. When an artificial closure or a bag is used, it is too air tight for long term storage and maturation. All the hard work that went into making a wine of high enough quality to age will be lost.
As for mid-tier wines, the story is different. These wines can have some age, maybe up to 5 years, but isn't required. A lot of wine these days is being made to be drunk immediately, and not age, which makes it perfectly suitable for other packing and closures. 

**So about the boxes:**

If there is such a large percentage of wine that falls into the mid-tier category, that doesn't require aging, then why isn't it in boxes? Some are. [Clif]( actually puts some decent stuff into a pouch. [Big House]( stuff (especially their ""red blend"" [most wines are blended with a small percentage of something else, but that's a soap box for another day]) can be found in a box, and are quite good for the price. There are also some eco-minded small producers (both old and new world) that use [tetra packs]( For the most part, most still aren't because of the stigma surrounding it. People see a box, they think of Fred Franzia's swill in-o-box, and turn their nose up to it. Wine is *incredibly* psychological to sell, and a bad package can turn people off to it regardless of the quality of what's in it.

TL;DR - Despite it's usefulness, boxed wine has a stigma that vineyards/companies won't invest in to break. "

I just saw a post about someone wanting to buy a new gaming computer, but they were worried about the cost. I had to comment and say, ""You can, but it would be a waste. You can get a great gaming experience with a mid-range system, and you'll save a lot of money in the process.""","give me the text of a reddit post from r/shutupandtakemymoney with title ""You can, but it would be a waste.""","Regardless of if it's a wine I represent or not, I will still point someone to good wine. I don't get people who don't do that. It would help break the pretentious stigma.

Anyway: this could take a bit of explaining. A lot of wine is aged in barrels (others in stainless steel or cement tanks). Quality wines always are if they desire that kind of treatment (some types of wine taste better unoaked [barrels are various types of oak]). One a side note, cheaper wines typically don't use barrels, but instead use staves, chips, or even essence to add the flavor and effect. Good wine that is meant to be aged, needs proper conditions and a real cork for proper gas exchange through the bottle. 

I'm giving you this background so you can fully understand why you both can and can't. Yes you can, because a lot of wine is already. At the same time you can't (or won't), because if you are investing the money into aging a wine in a nice french oak barrel, you're not going to want to package it in something that won't let it age more. The barrel will add and change the wine, and then the process will continue in a neutral glass bottle (but without the oak adding to it). As the wine ages, it chemically changes, and proper barrel aging is one of the many parts that lets you do that. If you took that wine, put it in a bag (bladder), and then drank it down the road, it would be rough, tannic, and for lack of a better word, tight.

TL;DR - You can, but it would be a waste."

It's tough out there right now. It's hard to find a job, especially one that you like. But don't give up hope. There are still ways to find joy in life.

Start by getting a hobby. It can be anything from cooking to playing an instrument to learning a new language. This can be a great way to pass the time, and it can even lead to a new career path.

Another way to find joy is to connect with your family, even if you don't get along. It's important to maintain those relationships and to show them that you care.

Finally, find a few people to be your friends. True friends are the ones that will stick by you through thick and thin. They will be there to listen to your problems and to encourage you.

I've been surrounded by suicides and every couple of years I am reminded of how far I've come. I was raised Christian but for me I felt a void for a very long time. I entertained thoughts of suicide a few times and the worst part about it was the apathy. I didn't feel anything, couldn't feel anything. Things would happen that I should have felt something about and I didn't. I'll come back to this in a second.

Not only have I wanted to do that myself in the past, I have an aunt who has tried committing suicide on 3 occasions. We don't talk about it but my whole family aren't sure if/when we'll be getting a call about her. We've been devastated every time we've received a call saying she tried committing suicide. Her reasons are because of a chemical imbalance. Its been almost a decade since her last attempt and were so happy she's still around.

Also I have a close friend who's father committed suicide. Every time I see or talk to her I see the effects of it. Shes a different person; don't get me wrong she's moved on and is living a happy life. But you can see the trauma sitting there, just under the surface. She fights depression now herself on the anniversary of his death every year. Her father sent her a final note in an email and she slept in that morning, she still blames herself.

Finally back to me. Getting back from that ledge is a battle, and one I didn't want to fight most days. I'd lost sight of God so prayer was out of the question; and why would he even want someone like me anyway? My life wasn't so terrible but I still wanted to take it. I felt whiny and hated myself all the more for it. I didn't have health insurance either so seeing a doctor about if it was a chemical balance wasn't an option so I took it day by day to see i I could get better. I was a lucky one, I didn't tell anyone other than my mom. 

I found reasons to be happy with myself. I started reading Scripture. I found Gods love and mercy. I became happy.

Its not an easy fight but it's a worthwhile one. I'm here if you need someone to talk to.

1) Using the tax system to take money from the rich to pay for programs that help the poor is a way of redistributing wealth. This means that people who have more money (the rich) pay more in taxes than people who have less money (the poor). This money is then used to fund programs that help the poor, such as food stamps, healthcare, and education.

2) Obama and his party (the Democrats) tend to prefer this type of redistribution more than the opposition (the Republicans). This is because the Democrats believe that the government should play an active role in helping those in need, while the Republicans believe that the government should focus more on helping people become self-sufficient.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/explainlikeimfive with title ""1) using the tax system to take money from the rich to pay for programs that help the poor; 2) Obama and his party tend to prefer it more than the opposition.""","""Redistribution"" is short for ""redistribution of wealth"" and means that the government forcibly changes the amount of money everyone has.  In other words, money is taken from people, in different amounts from each person, and is redistributed among the people.  Taxation is by necessity redistribution, because it's essentially impossible for everyone to receive the exact same in benefits that he/she pays out in taxes.

That said, some forms of taxation can redistribute more dramatically than others.  A more progressive tax system, in which high-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than low-income individuals, will redistribute more wealth from high-income folks to low-income folks than a tax system where everyone pays the same rate.  (You can also argue that some aspects of the tax system redistribute wealth from the poor to the rich; for example, Social Security taxes are only taken out of your paycheck up to a certain point, which I believe is around $112,500 a year.  So for people who make more than that, the percentage of their income going to Social Security tax is less than it is for people who make less.)

So what does this have to do with Obama?  Traditionally, Democrats have tended to prefer a progressive tax rate, on the idea that taking money primarily from the rich to pay for government programs that generally help the poor makes for a better society.  (Programs like Social Security and Medicare would fall into this category.)  Republicans have tended to prefer a less progressive tax rate, on the idea that people should take responsibility for themselves and that higher tax rates on the rich punish them for their success.  Republicans often use the term ""redistribution"" because it suggests an unfairness in taking money from one person and giving it to another.  And since the big question in American politics these days is whether we should reelect President Obama, Republicans have said that Obama's policies seek to redistribute wealth.

tl;dr: 1) using the tax system to take money from the rich to pay for programs that help the poor; 2) Obama and his party tend to prefer it more than the opposition."

I recently started running and have been trying to find ways to stay motivated. One thing I've been doing is setting small goals for myself, like running a certain distance or running to a certain place. But I've also been trying to focus on the experience of running, rather than just the goals. 

To that end, I've been trying to ""show, don't tell"" when it comes to running. Instead of thinking about how far I want to run or how fast I want to go, I've been trying to focus on how my body feels when I'm running, how the scenery looks, and how I'm feeling mentally. 

I find that this approach helps me to stay in the present and enjoy the experience of running more. It's also helped me to stay motivated and keep pushing myself, because I'm able to appreciate the process of running rather than just the end result. 

Has anyone else tried this approach? What has been your experience?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/running with title ""Show, don't tell.""","Not even this, there's just a huge difference between saying you're silly and being silly.

I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I've always been fascinated by the idea of the Jedi and the Sith. It's clear that the Sith were able to manipulate Anakin because of his weak will, and it's always made me wonder if the Jedi can do the same.

Is it a power exclusive to the Sith, or do the Jedi have the same ability?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskScienceFiction with title ""Anakin was a weak will man child, the Sith were able to prey on this weakness with relative ease.

In all honesty though, Anakin is portrayed as a self absorbed, dim witted, man child. He is incredibly immature and lacks any kind of foresight. Also he is incredibly subject to his emotions and has little control over them. Essentially he's a big baby. 

Papa Palpatine realizes all of this and sees a great opportunity to control his emotions, albeit through manipulation or the force. Yes that's right I would actually consider Anakin among the weak minded fools who can be controlled by the force mind trick. While, regular Jedi are able to manipulate people with a single thought, it could be very possible for Sith to extend this ability to actually control people's emotions, especially those who are very weak willed and overly emotional. 

Anakin becomes fueled by fear and anger. This is probably why Yoda warns of bringing an over emotional child into the Jedi Order. This is also why Yoda said that he was ""too old"". Likely this merely meant that he had too much emotional baggage. While, Luke is much older when Yoda trains him, he actually has more control of his emotions than Anakin ever had, and this is even after he had his family bar-be-qued in from of him.

If you're looking to improve your game in League of Legends, I recommend you to look up your champion on www.solomid.net/guides and follow the build they recommend. Even if you feel confident in your own build order, it's still worth taking a look at the recommended builds to see if there are any adjustments you can make to better suit your playstyle. 

Also, when you hit level 30, don't rush into ranked games. You'll likely end up losing and people in ranked flame way harder than in normals, even when you're winning. So take your time and practice in normals first.

My experience smurfing in League of Legends has been largely positive, but for a rare few I've encountered, it can be quite the opposite. I've seen players who have had a negative attitude, who have been overly aggressive, or who have just been downright toxic. These players can ruin the experience for everyone, and it's important to try to avoid them.

I've also seen players who are new to the game, or who are returning after a long break, and they may not be aware of the current meta or the most effective strategies. It's important to be patient and understanding with these players, as they can be a great asset to your team if given the chance.

Overall, smurfing can be a great way to improve your skills and have fun. Just remember to be respectful and understanding of your fellow players, and you should have a great time.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/leagueoflegends with title ""My experience smurfing has been largely positive, but for a rare few""","I just want to say that: I just made a new smurf account so that I could get a new account to try ranked with, without tainting my main.

Bad smurfs will get angry at every mistake you do, use terms like ""meta"" or ""counter jungle"" to try to confuse you and to make themselves look cool, and then get angry when you couldn't tryhard as hard as them. They will get angry at team mates saying ""gg noob team"" at end of the game. They will usually lose because they are unable to adapt to lower level playstyles and will get stomped because they try to conform to ""high elo play tactics"" while playing againts level 5's.

tl;dr all those people calling you bad are bad. Just keep playing, and keep ignoring players. Just remember, if they get matched up with you, they are just as bad, if not worse than you, due to them getting matchmaked with you. "

Smurfs may get frustrated and angry at times, but at least they don't do or say anything that makes you facepalm. On the other hand, noobs that are open to suggestions and willing to learn are just as good, if not better. Sure, they may mess up a few times, but with the right guidance and a bit of patience, they can be just as good as the more experienced players.

Hey everyone,

I'm sure many of us have experienced this in ranked games, but I'm just curious if anyone else has had this happen to them too. I'm a Diamond player in League of Legends and I've been climbing the ladder for a while now, but I've noticed that I get flamed almost every game, even when I'm carrying the team. I'm usually the one getting the most kills, objectives, and pushing the hardest, but I still get flamed for it.

I know it's part of the game, and I'm not asking for special treatment or anything, but it's still really frustrating. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you deal with it?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/leagueoflegends with title ""Carry team 90% of the time, still get flamed](""","Don't sweat it, man.

Chicagoans, 

I'm voting ""no"" on this amendment because it does nothing to address our $83 billion pension liability. It's a distraction from the real problem: our elected officials. 

It's time for us to hold our elected officials accountable and demand real change. We need to make sure they're doing the hard work of finding real solutions to our pension crisis. 

We can't let them get away with passing the buck and passing the blame. We need to stand up for ourselves and make sure our elected officials are doing the job we elected them to do.

This amendment is toothless.  It does nothing to resolve the huge unfunded pension problem ($83 BILLION!) in Illinois since [nearly all past increases in benefits have passed by more than a 3/5 majority](  OP isn't alone in being confused by the amendment.  It is so poorly worded and drafted that no one really knows what its consequences will be.

Worse yet, this amendment is counterproductive.  We shouldn't be so quick to amend our constitution.  Constitutions are designed to provide stability and continuity in our political system.  They should only be amended to address fundamental flaws in the way our political system functions.  In the last few years, however, we've been amending our constitution to address single issue problems like our terrible governors or our unfunded pensions.  But the problem is not how our governor is elected and maintains his office, or how many legislators are required to vote on pension increases.  Our problem is the shitty legislators and governors we keep electing!  Amending our constitution to require a 3/5 majority vote on pensions or to recall a governor does not fix our state's problems; on the contrary, it only deludes and lulls us into thinking we've addressed the problem.  All this amendment does is give Madigan and his ilk cover to claim they did something about our unfunded liabilities, while kicking this 83 BILLION DOLLAR can down the road.

Hey everyone!

I'm a long-time sufferer of anxiety and panic attacks, and I've recently been struggling with a fear of shitting myself. It's something that's been a problem for me for a while, but my general anxiety and panic attacks have been improving the last few months.

Years ago started getting panic attacks when I got too high from weed, so I finally quit that, probably about 9 months ago. Still drank a lot though. Then after a weekend of non-stop drinking at a friend's house, I had to make a 2 hour drive early Monday morning to get home for class and work. I didn't go to the bathroom before I left and about halfway home I could tell I definitely had a case of the beer shits. I decided to hold it though. I thought, 'Hey, I can make it home then I'll have my own toilet to go in'. 

I was wrong. I was probably twenty minutes from home, driving on a particularly hairy stretch of road when I had my first real panic attack. I thought I was having either a stroke or heart attack. My arms and legs went numb and I had to pull over to the side of the road. I was sweating profusely and I had my friend take over the wheel and drive me to the nearest gas station, where I had multiple episodes of diarrhea.

I went to the school nurse who told me I probably just had some food poisoning and a small panic attack, but that I would be fine in a few days. I wasn't. I was getting that adrenaline rush, pounding heart with skipped beats, numb arms and legs, terrible migraines, stomach cramps, and uncontrollable bowel movements, where I would have to go immediately no matter where I was. I had convinced myself I was going through alcohol withdrawals, especially because whenever I had an episode I would get really bad shakes.

So first I got an EKG. Normal. I ended up doing a week's worth of stool samples to be sent to the lab to see what was wrong with my stomach. For 2 straight weeks I never had a solid bowel movement, and this was on a BRAT diet, with no booze. Came back totally normal. So doctor put me on probiotic pills to take once a day to help my stomach, and sent me to a therapist. Therapy worked wonders for me. Taught me that what I was feeling was just discomfort and to accept it.

Unfortunately I had to stop going after about 10 weeks because I graduated, and the therapist was through the school. Then the problems started back up again. Difference is, I now know that I'm not dying and I can deal with the panic attacks on my own. Saw my doctor from childhood, and he put me on Celexa and Xanax for emergencies. Haven't taken either yet. My condition has improved with regular exercise, a healthier diet, and a lot less booze. However, my biggest problem still is being stuck driving on a freeway, and being afraid that I'm going to shit myself. Hasn't happened yet, but it's still something I'm very afraid of.

The idea that the Iranian people are not the same as their government is dishonest and self-delusional.

This is dishonest not only to non-Iranians but a self delusional explanation for the dire state of Iran. Not only do I think it's foolish to compare Iranians to Israelis culturally, a lot of Iranians tend to say the mullahs are different than the people and that their policies is not a reflection of everyday Iranians. This is simply not true.

The Islamic Republic has a strong support in Iran among merchants, rural residents, low-mid income families and the religious elite. And although some of its social values are not shared among the young educated Iranians, its culture of oppression and ""king like rule"" is still relevant even among them. 

Iranians may set up rave parties in their basements or have bottles of whiskey in their homes, but culturally they're not ready for democracy. The idea of freedom of speech or questioning authority is something that has not settled well in Persian culture. For example the father figure still has the last word on most family matters and the idea of younger people speaking their minds is usually frowned upon. These are traditions that have defined Persian people for generation, and until they're overcome at the micro level, you can't expect a regime like the Islamic Republic becoming irrelevant at the macro level. 

That was just one example, but there many more like it that demonstrate a lack of readiness by Iranian for true democracy. However, I don't believe it's all bad news. I believe out of all islamic/arab countries in the middle east, Iran is by far the most progressive. For example in recent years there has been a progressive push in sexual openness and family planning. However, like I said there is still a long way to go.

It has long been accepted that the monotheistic belief systems of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are based on the notion that Yahweh/Allah/God is the one and only true God. Statements such as “There is no god but Allah” and “You shall have no other gods before Me” are often seen as evidence of this belief. However, recent archaeological and linguistic anthropological evidence has shown that the belief in Yahweh/Allah/God as a monotheistic Deity is a relatively recent development. This evidence suggests that Yahweh/Allah/God was originally part of a polytheistic pantheon of gods, and that the idea of monotheism was a human-constructed concept. This renders the monotheistic foundations of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam invalid, as their core belief is based on an inherently flawed concept.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/atheism with title ""Yahweh/Allah/God is claimed to be the only true God (ex., “There is no god but Allah”/“You shall have no other gods before Me""), yet significant physical archeological and linguistic anthropological evidence documents the doctrinal growth of Yahweh/Allah from a subordinate rain/fertility/warrior Deity in a large polytheistic pantheon of revealed and worshiped Deities into a politically and militarily motivated monotheistic Deity belief system. In other words, the evidence points to monotheistic Yahwehism/Allahism as a human-made concept and not as a self-revealed monotheistic Deity.

Why do you believe?  Perhaps you should examine that position.  You mention Christians and the Second Coming - so the God to whom you are referring to is the monotheistic YHWH/Yahweh/Jehovah/Allah/God of Abraham (all names for the same Deity).  What supports you belief in that Deity vs. the other 6000+ deities for which you appear to be atheistic?

&gt; To help me see clearly, could you recommend me something to read?

Specific to the monotheistic Yahweh - A foundational belief in the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) is that Allah, God, or Yahweh/YHWH, is the only true revealed God. As this is also the core of the Tanakh (Judaism), Bible (Christianity), and Qur'an/Koran (Islam); questions concerning the source of, and the validity of, this monotheistic Deity would raises significant doubt as to the Holy Book's validity as the word of God/Yahweh/Allah. Yet, within the Holy Scriptures of predecessor Ugarit and Canaanite, and early Israelite religions/societies/cultures, the evidence points to the growth in the belief of the monothesitic Yahweh God from a polytheistic foundation of the El God pantheon in the ancient Ugarits and Canaanites who became the early Israelites. Yahweh (son of El, the Father God) was a subordinate fertility/rain/warrior local desert God whom, through a process of convergence, differentiation and displacement (synthesis and syncretism), was elevated to a monolatry and then to a monotheistic Deity.

Evidential sources related to the development and growth of Allahism/Yahwehism:

Hey ELI5, 

I'm trying to understand the process of how China elects its president. I've heard that it involves 2700 delegates and representatives from all over China, but I don't know exactly how it works. Can someone explain it to me like I'm five? 

So here's how it works: 2700 delegates and representatives from all over China elect a Central Committee (~370 from a pre-chosen party list). This Central Committee then elects a Politburo, which is made up of 24 members. The Politburo then elects an exclusive 9-member committee called the Standing Committee, and the head of this committee is the President of China. 

So basically, the 2700 delegates and representatives elect a Central Committee, which elects a Politburo, which in turn elects a Standing Committee, and the head of that is the President. 

Hope this helps!

 Edit: [shout out to custerc below for his last two paragraphs.]( and [TheAgora for a  much  more comprehensive explanation.](""","The Chinese system isn't exactly transparent, but there have been several decent attempts I've seen. 

The National People's Congress is basically a huge gathering of all the most important people in China (leaders, generals, party chiefs, governors, mayors, managers of big state-owned business etc.) and what regional officials consider to be 'grassroots' role models that can range from teachers and doctors, to farmers and scientists. Big important people make up 70%, and the role models 30%.

The congress only happens every five years, and elects ~370 people to become part of the party's elite Central Committee (selected from a pool of people just a bit over ~370 - see a problem?). After being elected, this committee then chooses 24 members (who were also kind of pre-chosen by the state party's leadership anyway). Those 24 members (called the Politburo) decide the new standing committee.

The new Standing Committee (which is the elite elite) is then revealed after the first meeting of the Central Committee. Currently has 9 members (so it's pretty exclusive) but it's rumoured that it'll go down to 7, which will make the quick decision making power of the Chinese government even quicker at making decisions as there'll be less discussion in the wake of reforms. The top of this elite elite standing comittee is the chair, who is also now the president of China. 
***
***TL;DR*** ~2700 Delegates and representatives from all over China elect a Central Committee (~370 from a pre-chosen party list), which in turn elects a Politburo (24 members). The Politburo then elects an exclusive 9-member committee called the Standing Committee, the head of this is the President.

""Hey everyone,

This is a common misconception about the Communist Party. The Communist Party isn't a political party like the Democrats or Republicans. Instead, it's a workers union. That means it's a group of people who come together to advocate for better working conditions and wages for workers.

Unlike with political parties, you don't vote for different unions. Instead, you vote for who does what within the union. For example, you might vote for a president of the union, or a treasurer, or someone to negotiate contracts with employers.

So while the Communist Party isn't a political party, it still plays an important role in the lives of workers. It helps to ensure that workers have a voice in the workplace and can fight for better wages and conditions.

Thanks for reading!""","give me the text of a reddit post from r/explainlikeimfive with title ""the Communist Party isn't a political party, it's a workers union. You don't vote for different unions, you just vote for who does what within the union.""","Here is an analogy I've used before and might help a 5 year old.

Imagine a private company owned by a single family (Imperial Dynasty). The dad would hand down ownership of the company to his son, and the only people who were managers in the company were either family members or people who were friends of the family. The workers in the company had no say in anything.

Eventually, the workers get tired of this and form a workers union to oppose management (communism is almost literally this in theory). Management doesn't like this and there is a big fight.

Normally management would not lose this kind of fight, except outsiders (Japanese) had taken over the board of directors and were really running things in the company, with the management team as puppets. Management loses and the union, led by Sun Yat-Sen, takes over the company.

Shortly after this, Sun Yat Sun dies. Almost immediately, there is another fight. Some of the workers want to become the new owners of the company (Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT). They are supported by the US.

The other workers think that replacing one management team with another is not likely to solve anything, and decide that the union should actually be the ultimate owners of the company, and that management should work for them, not the other way around. This was led by Mao Zedong and was supported by the Soviets.

Big fight, and Mao wins. The KMT retreat to Formosa, kick the natives to the curb, and create the ROC (Taiwan). So now the union (Communist Party) is in charge of the mainland (China).

From their perspective, they are not really a political party like we would understand it. They are, in their minds, the representatives of the people, like union leaders. As a result, there really isn't a reason to vote for them, since they ARE the people. Voting and discussion is more about what the people are going to do and who they are going to appoint to do it.

If you think about what you know about unions, you'll note that normally there is only one union in the company. The workers don't usually vote for which union represents them. They may vote for which union members are in charge of various jobs, but the union is the union. Similarly, there is no opposing ""party"" to the Communist Party.

I've grossly oversimplified some things, but this is why China has a completely different system than the US, and why talking about political parties in the context actually doesn't make much sense. They actually have lots of elections and votes, but it's all low level things. The Party, as the direct representative of the people (theoretically) just acts on behalf of the people (theoretically) without any need for elections (theoretically).

This is also why the leaders of the country, like the President and Premier, are appointed by the Communist Party. There are votes and negotiations behind the scenes, but basically it's a case of the union being the Board of Directors and appointing the President, Secretary and Treasurer. They even use those terms.

So, not a democracy. But also not a dictatorship. The Premier reports to the Party. It's more of a rule by committee. It is very authoritarian, however.

The show that is going on right now over the National Peoples Congress is primarily to reassure the people that the Party is still representing them properly. So you will see lots of flowery speeches, discussions about what the people want, and so on. These are more about making sure that the Party appears to be aligned with the best interests of the people than about the decision making itself.

**TL;DR:** the Communist Party isn't a political party, it's a workers union. You don't vote for different unions, you just vote for who does what within the union."

Hey guys, 

So I was driving home from the store the other day and got into a pretty bad car accident. It was really scary, and I'm just thankful that I'm okay. 

Anyway, after the accident, I was listening to the radio and this song came on that really spoke to me in that moment. It's called ""Upside Down"" by Woah Man. It's a really powerful song and I just wanted to share it with y'all. 

Take care and stay safe everyone! 

Cheers.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Music with title ""caraccident/thissong/upsidedown/woahman""","last year my sister and I were driving from Portland to San Francisco late night.

I had to hold on to the oh'shit handle to keep from getting dragged under the car, as glass, gravel and sparks showered my face (fuck you oxford comma).

I don't remember this part, but apparently while we were skidding, my sister looked down half expecting me to be mangled and dying, but instead, with my left arm hooked around the passenger seat head rest, I was looking up at her with a goofy smile, giving the thumbs up.

when we came to a stop about 150 yards later and I realized what had just happened, I looked back at my sister dangling from the drivers seat, and we exchange a look.

Somehow the ipod stayed plugged in and was still functioning, and it was playing this song. Just at that moment I hear the lyric ""with my feet in the air and my head on the ground"". Now my sister's band always covers this song and it still kind of still freaks me out to hear.

Hey everyone!

I'm a big fan of MMA and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills. Recently I've been trying to focus on learning as much as I can from every position. I've been trying to learn a variety of techniques from every position, so that I can have a wide range of options to choose from. Once I have a considerable amount of options from every position, I can then refine my skill set and focus on the techniques that work best for me.

I'm curious to hear what other MMA fans do to improve their skills. What strategies do you use to learn and refine your skills?

Thanks!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/MMA with title ""Learn everything, try anything, refine your skill set after you have a considerable amount of options from every position.""","Honestly? MMA is still fairly early in its evolution, new generations of fighters come in and change the entire dynamic of the sport. 

The 1st generation was mostly style vs style competition, where as the 2nd generation took from various arts to strengthen a weakness. Wrestlers learned how to strike, BJJ guys learned how to wrestle, Strikers learned how to defend takedowns, etc.

3rd generation were the beginning of what we recognize as ""MMA"" today, instead of just simply adding a few things to their arsenal... they began to train in many styles.

4th generation is what I would refer to as a fighter like GSP, because the reason he dominates his opponents so much is his ability to transition from striking to grappling, and grappling to striking.

The problem with BJJ at the moment is that everyone has begun to train it consistently, so the level of skill needed to still submit someone is way higher. There are a lot of techniques that don't really belong in MMA, but I think they're misinterpreting what's actually going on. I sincerely believe that a lot of BJJ guys are stubborn, and refuse to learn how to grapple outside of their position of preference.

I've lost count of how many times I've seen wonderful grapplers that were perfectly setup for a leglock, or a triangle anywhere other than from off your back... and everyone just goes for the same old techniques, over and over again, but if that's the case? Why are they surprised? There's this thing in BJJ that's similar to anti-intellectualism, because it's frowned upon to try anything ""unorthodox"", guys simply dismiss these things as low percentage moves that won't help them in MMA.

My philosophy is that you should try everything, and anything, at least once. I'm not saying you guys need to start playing inverted guard 24/7, or trying to hit a Berimbolo sweep when there are other avenues open to exploit. The problem I have with the current era of MMA is that while it's smart to stick to the basics, by doing so you're completely overlooking numerous techniques that could have won you the fight. Guys take the back of someone... and all they try to do is go for the RNC. Very few recognize that you can transition into an armbar from there, and even less people realize that triangles are open all day from back control. Obviously you have to sometimes play it safe, because you don't want to end up losing position... but there's no reason to keep going for a RNC if a guy is giving you his arm on a platter.

tl;dr -- Learn everything, try anything, refine your skill set after you have a considerable amount of options from every position."

I've seen Mary Poppins at least 1400 times, and every time I watch it I'm reminded of how magical it is. From the catchy songs to the amazing visuals, it's a movie that never gets old.

At the time my mother worked in a small bar by the beach, one of the few places on the island with electricity. By chance they had an old TV in the back, and so one day while my mother was working she sat me in the office with my usual assortment of books, pencils and paper, and started the movie in the background. I was transfixed immediately, and as soon as I learned to rewind the tape I watched *Mary Poppins* on a loop, day after day, for well over a year. It wasn't until later that I was told that other movies existed, and that when we moved to England I'd be able to watch them. 

I eventually wore out the tape, but not before I'd watched it three to five times daily, six days a week, for at least fifteen months. Even a low-end estimate would mean that I watched that movie 1400 times. I quickly abandoned it when I discovered that other movies did, in fact, exist, but by then I'd memorised practically every detail of every frame of that film.

But a spade of freshly-turned earth would contain thousands of better candidates for godhood.""","I don't believe you've thought this through sufficiently. You're imagining the vast scale of the universe and assuming that anything is possible, but in this case its scale is the greatest obstacle.

The universe is a large system of mostly stars, perhaps 9x10^21 in the observable universe. But it's a *single system* and therefore cannot ""evolve"" in any sense that would promote a degree of organization that might be construed as sentience. An eyedropper with 0.27 CC volume of water (less than six drops) has 9x10^21 molecules in it, and it's not going to be intelligent or even *living*, because there is no conceivable process that would bring it to that point in isolation--as the universe most certainly is, and even if there were there's simply not enough complexity there to work with.

Use ourselves as an example. An adult human brain masses about 1.4 kilograms. It's about 77% water, 11% lipids and 8% protein, so it has around 1.4 x 10^26 atoms. That's about 16,000 times as many atoms as there are stars in the observable universe.

And those atoms can react together *instantaneously*, with even the slowest thought crossing the brain in less than ¼ of a second--that's 125 million traversals before a child is even a year old. Compare that to the universe, or even one galaxy. A light-speed impulse takes 100,000 years to cross the Milky Way, and could have done so only 110,000 times since it formed. The universe itself--even the *observable* universe--is too large for an impulse to cross it *at all*, so there's simply no way for one side of it to share any kind of sentience with the other side.

Even if you allowed stars to somehow function as synaptic analogs, or allowed solar winds to interact intelligently, or made pulsars carriers for nerve impulses, what does that get you? There's simply not enough time to develop intelligence. Even if you allowed for vastly more time, say *hundreds of trillions* of years, and 10,000 times as many stars, all while keeping the universe in an impossibly compact steady state (say, a billion light-years across), we're still imagining the equivalent of *two days* of brain activity of a full-term human fetus.

But there may be an infinite number of universes, right? And out of that infinite number, *some* of them might have some kind of organization resembling a thought process, right? Well, that may be, but I hope you see that given their size and the restrictions of information theory, the most intelligent conceivable universe could scarcely have the brains of even a developmentally disabled [nematode](

[WIP album]( - here are the shots from last saturday, as well as progress shots in between then and now.

**How it works:** You start a match with 2 bases, with a shield each. Every half a second or so, each base spawns a ""goon"" that slowly trundles towards the enemy base. If they collide with another goon or with the shield, they die. Every time a goon collides with the shield, it loses health. Once the shield is down, the goons can collide with the base, bringing its health down. Once the base health is down, that team loses.

Players can build things behind the shields, like turrets, shield rechargers, power generators, etc. and this uses up available Power. Turrets can shoot goons in the same lane as them.

It seems to me that a lot of Americans have an irrational fear of national healthcare. I mean, most of the world has that kind of system and is successful, why would America be different?

It's true that many countries in the world have some form of national healthcare, and they're doing just fine. In fact, they're doing better than the US in many ways. The US spends more on healthcare than any other country in the world, yet it has some of the worst health outcomes. It's not just about the cost either. The US also has some of the highest rates of infant mortality, maternal mortality, and preventable deaths.

So why is there such an irrational fear of national healthcare in the US? It's hard to say for sure, but I think it has a lot to do with the power of the healthcare industry in the US. The healthcare industry is one of the most powerful lobbies in the US, and it has a vested interest in keeping the current system in place. It's also likely that many Americans simply don't understand how national healthcare works, and are scared of the perceived consequences of it.

Regardless of the reasons, it's clear that the US needs to make some changes to its healthcare system. National healthcare could be the answer, and it's time for Americans to take a more rational look at the issue.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/canada with title ""It seems to me that a lot of Americans have an irrational fear of national healthcare.

I'm a big believer in celebrating creativity. Whether it's in the world of Feed the Beast or elsewhere, I think it's important to take the time to appreciate the amazing things people are doing.

So if you're looking to have some fun and party, come join me! I'm always down for a good time. But if you'd rather go somewhere else, that's cool too. Just make sure you have a good time wherever you go.

Cheers!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/feedthebeast with title ""I live to celebrate creativity. You can party with me, or party somewhere else. Either way, have fun!""","Howdy, y'all!

I'm that Joe Hills guy, and I work hard to make videos focused on hilarity over technical precision.

Some folks don't like how I talk, which is fair, as I have pursued humor to challenge myself rather than to universally please.

If you watch what I make and you like what you see, I thank you and appreciate your time. If you don't like what you see, the time you spent is still appreciated, and I encourage you to check out other guys from Britain and Canada like Biffa and Topmass whose voices you might find less jarring.

I don't usually like to brag, but I just saved a familiar shop owner at least a couple hundred bucks by pointing out a pricing error. I was in the store looking for a bottle of bourbon when I noticed that a bottle of Buffalo Trace Stagg and a bottle of Weller were both priced at $100. I knew that Stagg was usually much more expensive than Weller, so I asked the owner about it. Sure enough, he had made a pricing mistake and was about to sell them both at the same price. He was so thankful that I caught it, and I was able to score Stagg and Weller for $100.

So I walk in and boom, all five bottles, gleaming in the light. Some of them were still wrapped, no price tags. So obviously I want all of them, but decide to be good and get Stagg and Weller because they were on the top of my list. 

I got to ring up, Stagg: 77.99, Weller: 23.99. Uh oh. They rang up the Weller as WL Weller 12 rather than the BTAC Weller. I felt bad not saying anything, so I ask for Frank (the owner). I explain the situation to him. He had at 5 Wellers still on the shelf. He says ""well, you just saved me a lot of money. rather than losing all that, i want to give you both of these for 100"".

My jaw dropped. Just goes to show, treat your local shop owners well, bring them business, and be honest. A little compassion goes a long way sometimes folks.

My dog is ridiculously expensive and also ridiculously awesome. I regret nothing.

Gas prices have been dropping for a while now and it's great for those of us who drive a lot. But when it comes to MPG, it's not as great of a deal as you'd think. Sure, MPG helps, but it's not as beneficial as it would be if gas prices were higher. 

For example, if you drive an average of 12,000 miles a year and get 25 MPG in your car, you'd save $120 from the lower gas prices. That's great, but if you had a car that got 35 MPG, you'd save $200. That's a difference of $80 a year. 

So for the regular driver, MPG only helps a little bit. If gas prices were higher, then MPG would be much more beneficial. But at the current gas prices, it's not as big of a deal.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Frugal with title ""MPG and cheap gas prices help but for a regular driver, not as much as you'd think.""","Cars are never ""worth it"" from a strictly financial perspective... its value decreases quite significantly as the chances of expensive repairs increase.

Honda website quotes base model starting at $26,305. You mention you're from California where average regular gas prices, according to gasbuddy.com, are currently at $3.792. This means you'll save $1.64/gallon. The CNG only has an 8 gallon tank, meaning you'll get 248 miles per full tank with its combined 31mpg.

In a regular 12,000 mile driving year, and assuming regular gas prices stay constant, you would need 387 gallons of natural gas, costing you $832/year and saving you $634.68/year over regular gas. Keep in mind that because of the CNG's tiny tank, you will have to go to a natural gas station about 48 times that year, essentially almost once a week.

Is saving $634.68/year worth it for you? Compare it, say, to the Civic Hybrid which costs $24,200 for the base model and gets a combined 44mpg, meaning that you would need 273 gallons of gas ($1,035). It has a 13.2 gallon gas tank meaning that you'd get 580 miles per full tank - 20.7 fillups per year!


**So the breakdown:**

**CNG: $26,305, spend $832/year on gas, 48 fillups/year**

**Civic Hybrid: $24,200, spend $1,035/year on gas, 20.7 fillups/year**


If you get the CNG, you'll save $200/year on gas vs the Civic Hybrid and it would take you 10 years to see that savings as you paid over $2,000 more for the CNG, not to mention the inconvenience of trying to find a natural gas station almost every week.

TL;DR: MPG and cheap gas prices help but for a regular driver, not as much as you'd think."

It seems to me that forming a positive belief that aliens exist is potentially inconsistent with an atheist's refusal to form positive beliefs where there is no evidence. Life is contingent, meaning that it depends on certain conditions in order to exist. We can recognize these conditions and use them as evidence to increase the probability of life existing elsewhere. On the other hand, there are no conditions required for a necessary being, so there is no evidence available to support the existence of such a being. Therefore, an atheist should be more cautious when forming positive beliefs about the existence of aliens, as there is no evidence to support the idea.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/DebateAnAtheist with title ""Forming a positive belief that aliens exist is potentially inconsistent (and a bad idea in general), given that the atheist in question refuses to form positive beliefs where there is no evidence. Also, life is contingent, whereas gods would not be contingent; recognizing the conditions favorable for life counts as evidence which at least increases the probability of life, whereas there are no conditions required for a necessary being, so there  isn't  that sort of evidence available.""","&gt; Can a logically consistent atheist believe that life on other planets exists?

Let's ignore for the moment the fact that you're going to get a bunch of statements to the effect that ""atheizm is just a lack of believes in gods!!1!"" There's nothing inconsistent about recognizing that the conditions for the formation of life on our planet are probably not unique to this planet, and indeed all indications are that they are ubiquitous. If anything, it would be foolish to suggest that life on other planets was *impossible*. While it may be improper to form a belief that there *is* life on other planets, there is nothing at all wrong with believing that life on other planets is *likely*.

Your question conflates the probability that there is life elsewhere in the universe with the probability that there is a single eternally existent entity with magical powers. I have no positive evidence that there is a fire burning anywhere within ten blocks of my house, but to form a belief to that effect is hardly a great offense -- it's nothing like forming a belief that there might be gods.

Indeed, if the atheist notes that she *shouldn't* form a belief that gods exist specifically because there is no evidence, she might yet be vindicated with respect to forming beliefs that life exists on other planets -- there *is* evidence that life exists elsewhere. Well, specifically, there is evidence that the *conditions* for life are elsewhere met.

You see, life is *contingent*. There are conditions which must be met if life is even to have a *possibility* of existing. Like the fire I may or may not believe is presently burning within a ten-block radius of my house, the *conditions* for life are surely somewhere met -- the question becomes one of whether or not there has been a spark. Since gods are [presumably] *necessary* (if they exist at all), there cannot be any special conditions which might count as [inductive] evidence -- so these two (gods and alien life) are not commensurate.

---

**tl;dr**: Forming a positive belief that aliens exist is potentially inconsistent (and a bad idea in general), given that the atheist in question refuses to form positive beliefs where there is no evidence. Also, life is contingent, whereas gods would not be contingent; recognizing the conditions favorable for life counts as evidence which at least increases the probability of life, whereas there are no conditions required for a necessary being, so there *isn't* that sort of evidence available."

This is a rather interesting topic to debate. I think that belief in god or gods has nothing to do with aliens. Aliens, by definition, are beings from other planets or galaxies, and god or gods are spiritual entities. The two concepts are completely unrelated and should not be confused.

The belief in god or gods is a personal, spiritual belief that has been around since the beginning of time. It is based on faith and is a way for people to find comfort and meaning in their lives. On the other hand, aliens are scientific and physical entities that have been speculated to exist, but have never been proven to exist. 

The two concepts are very different and should not be confused. Belief in god or gods is a matter of faith, while aliens are a matter of science. Although some people may believe that aliens are related to god or gods, there is no scientific evidence to suggest this. Therefore, belief in god or gods has nothing to do with aliens.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/DebateAnAtheist with title ""Belief in god or gods has nothing to do with aliens.""","There is a certain likelihood that aliens may exist. However, this likelihood is based on a few assumptions about things we don't know enough about *yet*. Such as:

* How common are planets? (we're making a lot of progress on this one)
* How common are planets capable of supporting life? (also making a little progress on this one)
* How likely is it that life will form in such an environment (we really can't know this one, until we actually visit other planets and check)

So as a logically consistent atheist, I'd believe alien life is possible, but we don't even know yet how likely it is. If I had to guess, I'd say about a 10% chance of life existing elsewhere in the universe.

Remember that one galaxy alone has about 300 billion stars, and there are many galaxies. We currently know of 849 extra-solar planets just in our neighbourhood.

**That is a different argument, though, to my atheism**. I believe there cannot be a god because the concept is logically inconsistent. Aliens *might* exist logically. We know life forms can exist because we *are* life forms. The same argument couldn't be used for gods, because we've never discovered any of them.

TL;DR: Belief in god or gods has nothing to do with aliens."

We often think of distance as a major factor when it comes to size and scale, but in reality, size is the dominant factor. On local scales, distance matters only as part of the function of size and distance, yielding the apparent size. In other words, the farther away an object is, the smaller it appears, but the size of the object is still the dominant factor. 

Take for example a star in the night sky. Even if it is a million light years away, its size is still the same. The only difference is that it appears smaller due to the vast distance between us and the star. Therefore, size is the dominant factor when it comes to local scales. 

This concept is important to remember when we are trying to understand the size and scale of objects in space. Distance matters, but size is the primary factor.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/space with title ""Distance matters only as part of the function of size and distance, yielding  apparent size . Size is the dominant factor, on local scales.""","The *apparent* size - which is a function of size and distance, so you're partly right - absolutely **does** matter.

There is light coming from the edges of the sun's disc, just as there is from the centre. That light, even when the sun is half blocked, is still illuminating the Earth's surface somwhat.

If the sun was just a single very bright light bulb, at the same distance (effectively a point-source), the moon moving across the sky would obscure it instantaneously - causing crisp shadows - there would be practically no ""peeking around"".

There is no law. This is a concept that many people struggle to understand, and yet it is one of the most important aspects of atheism.

Atheism is the belief that there is no God or divine power. This means that there is no higher power to create or enforce laws. Laws are created and enforced by humans, and therefore they are subject to human interpretation and change.

This means that, while laws can be beneficial, they are not absolute and can be altered or even abolished. It also means that laws can be used to oppress and control people, which is why it is important to have a system of checks and balances to ensure that laws are just and fair.

Ultimately, there is no law beyond that which we create for ourselves. We must take responsibility for our own actions and create laws that are just and fair to all.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/TrueAtheism with title ""There is no law.""","So there is no law?

Hello everyone!

I recently started playing the game RIFT, and I have to say, it is like Burning Crusade and Lich King expansions from WoW had a baby and that baby grew up into a beastly SteamPunk geek who enjoys painting beautiful portraits just to make people happy.

The game has a lot of different aspects to it, from crafting, to exploring, to questing, and more. The game also has a great art style, with a mix of steampunk and fantasy elements. The graphics are also amazing, and the game runs smooth on my PC.

The game also has a great story line, with a lot of twists and turns, and it is very engaging. The game also has a lot of different classes to choose from, and each class has its own unique abilities and skills.

Overall, I am really enjoying the game, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new game to play. The game is definitely worth checking out, and I can't wait to see what else the developers have in store for us.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Rift with title ""Game feels like Burning Crusade and Lich King expansions from WoW had a baby and that baby grew up into a beastly SteamPunk geek who enjoys painting beautiful portraits just to make people happy...""","First Impressions?  Ok, here I go.  I was mainly a WoW player and played since day one till i quit in Cata.  This expansion feels a lot like Burning Crusade, mixed with Lich King combined, which in my book, its awesome, since I believe those where the best WoW expansions.  

Rift feels like a completely new game.  Capes are a welcome addition, giving the characters some fluidity  that they needed.  The mobs in the new starting zones have a Beast/SteamPunk feeling that somehow just merges right.  Oh, and the sights!  The zones are HUGE.  Also, Carnage quests brings more streaming to questing which I found quite welcome, and Im quite liking the extra xp and motivation while exploring this zones.

At first I started experimenting with the new rogue class, but didn't quite get the hang of it, so decided to run with the prebuild Bard class, and OH BOY, Bards feel so OP, or at least, suits my play style perfectly, with their new direct heals and buffs all around, while keeping a high enough dps that increases survavillity.

After doing a few quest, I found a few fishing ponds untouched, and decided to fish in the new areas, and ended up getting achievements for fishing all the types fish of the area, but since I haven't trained the GrandMaster skills, didn't level up my fishing... &gt;.&gt;  

Finally, I found the main new city, Cape Jule, and spent all my money in getting the GrandMaster skills, which left me with almost no plat (about 200 plat in new skills and related).

So far, I have found the game quite enjoyable that Im not even planning on using the XP pots to gain xp faster, since all the scenery, ambience and quest lines have the right feeling, and don't want to rush though it, which, imho, means they GOT me as a player.  Can't wait to get home and keep playing :)

**tldr**: Game feels like Burning Crusade and Lich King expansions from WoW had a baby and that baby grew up into a beastly SteamPunk geek who enjoys painting beautiful portraits just to make people happy...

Hey everyone! 

I'm looking for a cheap picture frame to take a hilarious picture of myself and fit it to the frame. I'm on a tight budget, so if anyone knows of a place I can get a good deal on a frame, I'd really appreciate it. 

Thanks in advance!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/santashelpers with title ""Find cheap picture frame, take hilarious picture of yourself and fit to frame""","Here's the thing about white elephant, dirty santa, etc... it's not about buying practical gifts that everyone will like. It's about finding something hilarious that makes the time with family more enjoyable and make the entire experience more memorable. 

I've done this in the past with my family, and the absolute best idea came from one of my whackier uncles. He basically went to a thrift store and bought an old picture frame for around $5. It was pretty decently sized... I'm not sure of the exact dimensions, but it was at least slightly larger than an average sheet of 8.5x11 printer paper. He then took a picture of himself wearing a ridiculous christmas sweater and giving the camera a thumbs up with an award-winning grin. He then spent ~$15-$20 at a print shop to get one copy of the image blown up to the appropriate size to fit the frame.

So when we all were passing around gifts, people weren't really sure what to expect... then when the first person unwrapped it, the game was on the rest of the night to see who would get stuck with the awful photo. It's still hanging proudly in my cousin's living room, and we still all joke about it even though it was years ago.

Just a thought :)

Hey everyone,

I feel like PC gamers need to make a statement and show the companies that we prefer to play on our platform, and that we aren't willing to make a sacrifice on the quality of our gaming experience. We've seen time and time again, with games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Fallout 76, that companies are willing to put out sub-par ports on PC, just to get the game out to a wider audience.

We need to make it clear that we're not okay with this. We're willing to pay for quality, and if companies want to make money from PC gamers, they need to make sure that their games are optimized for the platform. We don't want to be the ones making the sacrifice.

So let's make our voices heard, and show the companies that PC gamers aren't willing to settle for anything less than the best.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/gaming with title ""PC gamers need to show the companies what platform we prefer and that we aren't willing to make a sacrifice.""","There will be a PC port, there has not been a single GTA that hasn't been on PC.

Anyway, here is why:

When Microsoft sees that console sales go up when a particular game comes out, they have successful done their job. Microsoft realizes that as long as they set up some sort of early release before PC, or some sort of content exclusivity deal, they stand to earn a lot more money because people are willing to spend an additional $200 on a console. Or PC gamers that also own and XBOX will buy it on XBOX so tey don't have to wait. Then, when the game comes out on PC, users like you won't buy it because you have already played it 6 months ago and then the games industry points fingers and says ""See, I told you people don't game on PC anymore"". Meanwhile, some of the butthurt fans that didn't get the PC version on the same day as the console version, feel betrayed so they decide not to purchase the game or support that 'evil' company by pirating the game instead.

As mature PC gamers, it is kind of our responsibility to tell the companies that we aren't happy being treated differently. It is also kind of our responsibility to buy the games when they do come out to support the company and let them know that we do exist and that we are a major part of their income. A lot of these companies also need to start putting fans slightly before overall income. The more you love your fans, the better your fans will treat you.

As much as some people don't like to hear it, piracy can be nearly eliminated by putting the game on Steam. The amount of money Valve earns from this deal is far less than the amount Rockstar would lose from piracy on the internet.

tl:dr - PC gamers need to show the companies what platform we prefer and that we aren't willing to make a sacrifice."

There's been a lot of talk about introducing duplicate champions into League of Legends, but I'm here to tell you that it's just not gonna happen. It would require too much work and resources, and Riot isn't willing to put that much effort into something that doesn't have a guaranteed payoff. It's just not a priority right now.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/leagueoflegends with title ""Duplicates = too much work. Not gonna happen.""","The reason DoTa could easily implement duplicates is because it started from Warcraft and the champs were units in Warcraft which could be duplicated and thus code had to be in place to account for this. Since LoL has had the assumption of unique champs on a team from the beginning the process of allowing multiples would require a code review of essentially the entire game.

TL;DR: Duplicates = too much work. Not gonna happen."

This post is about how bad teams don't necessarily mean bad teamwork on your part. Sure, you might lose more often with ""econ builds"" (cheaper builds) than you would with ""expensive builds"", but that doesn't mean that you're doing something wrong.

Winning with ""expensive builds"" is great and all, but that doesn't mean that you can't still win with ""econ builds"". It's all about playing smart and working together with your team. Even if you don't have the best mechs, you can still come out on top if you play as a team.

So don't let bad teams and losses get you down. Keep playing smart and working together, and you'll eventually get the wins you're looking for.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/mwo with title ""Bad team =/= Bad teamwork on your part. Losing + ""econ builds"" much less than Winning some + ""expensive builds"".""","""Contributing to the team"" doesn't mean that your team is a good one. All it implies is that you act in such a manner as to help your team win. With proper explanation as to ""How you would help your team win"" would help much more than just throwing money at you for doing poorly.

Those ""economy"" fleas with 1ML teams won't be winning much, if at all. I have highly weighted ""winning"" over personal gain per match. Help your team win, win more often, gain much more money than ""econ fleas""

Edit: Perhaps a Team Pool could solve the problem you propose. A team is given a flat rate of 160k to divvie up between its members, divided up into subgroups, including perhaps ""Spotting Bonuses"" totaling 20k, ""Damage"" bonuses totaling something like 50k, and Killing/Assisting totaling 90k, to be divided up based on how much you did with comparison to your team. For the 7 ""econ flea"" example, if you were to run an assault or LRM boat, the 7 ""econ fleas"" would divide up the 20k pretty evenly, you would get a large majority of the ""Damage"" pool compared to everyone else, and you would get a large portion of the Kill/Assist as well. Please note that this is a very rough example, and that numbers could be tweaked, new categories would be possible, different weighting, etc.

;tldr Bad team =/= Bad teamwork on your part. Losing + ""econ builds"" much less than Winning some + ""expensive builds""."

I agree that the economy needs to be improved, but I'm concerned that some of the ideas in your manifesto could have harsh consequences for people who have no control over the situation. For example, increasing taxes on businesses could lead to job losses and reduced wages for employees, who are already struggling with the current economic climate. Additionally, cutting government services could lead to an even greater burden on the most vulnerable members of society.

While I understand that some tough decisions need to be made to move the economy forward, I think it's important to consider the potential impacts of these policies on those who are already struggling.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/mwo with title ""while I agree the economy could use some work, I feel that your manifesto could potentially punish some people rather harshly for things outside of their control.""","While I disagree with a lot of your post (while for the most part I appreciate it's ""heart""), there are only two parts that I can make a reasonable rebuttal at this time. The issue of the games instability at this time is one. To my knowledge, most people who are AFK any more are because of some sort of connection glitch/fps bug/didn't start the match with weapons/who knows what. Furthermore, I know a lot of people who this happens to more often than others. Because of this combination of factors, it seems that your manifesto would currently severely punish players who's hardware isn't playing nice with the engine. That's hardly their fault and it could cause some very soar players.


The other issue is that, while you say that the trial mechs are there specifically for no worry, I must admit that there are times when I simply am not a good pilot. And by that, I mean most of the time. I have my games, but really I am not great. Furthermore, I don't expect that I will ever be that great. I don't want to be forced into piloting only trial mechs because there is too much risk running my own to only take it out on special occasions. Just for clarification, I have been playing quite some time and at this point, I don't know how much better, I as a person can become. Maybe some of it has to do with the rather low fps and not quite high end enough computer to run it, but I think I also am just not enough of a ""hardcore"" player on a typical basis in order to really be awesome. Enough of the self bashing though, I know there are people worse than me, and there are people who will always be worse than me. I don't want them to feel like they shouldn't be playing the game either, just because that isn't going to change.

tl;dr while I agree the economy could use some work, I feel that your manifesto could potentially punish some people rather harshly for things outside of their control."

Covenant were often outmatched by UNSC forces on the ground, but their superior space-based firepower gave them the upper hand in most engagements. From the devastating plasma bombardment of Reach to the brutal glassing of Harvest, the Covenant's ability to rain death from above was a major factor in their success. Even when UNSC forces were able to muster enough ground forces to push back the Covenant, their orbital superiority often allowed them to quickly regroup and launch a counter-attack. It's no wonder that the UNSC's space-based capabilities were a major focus of their efforts during the war.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/gaming with title ""Covenant were shitty ground troops, but space superiority gave them the upper hand.""","That's what would happen if the Covenant were smart. In halo lore, the reason the Covies lost was because their idea of combat was a sort of close-ranged, honor-based system. To humans, massive hammers or glowing sword were just sorta outdated after gunpowder become more accurate over long distances, but the Elites and Brutes saw them as par-for-the-course, and their tech reflects that. Why build a tanks with a short-range, slow-moving mortar when you could have a tank with a faster, more damaging shell? When you want to thin up the enemy *right behind this wall* so that your swordsmen can focus on the infantry out front.

In addition, the Covanent saw Forerunner tech a sacrosanct, and updating was a sin. Thus, human tech, while technically more simple, could be more effective when employed intellegently. 

The problem faced by the UNSC was how to fight them in space. Human ships were generally more frail, and packed less firepower. For instance, the MAC guns on UNSC frigates required about a minute to fully charge up, and needed to be pointed in the right direction. For a slower moving ship facing a faster-moving ship, using the MAC guns would have been suicidal without extensive preperation. 

TL;DR Covenant were shitty ground troops, but space superiority gave them the upper hand."

I work at a convenience store and recently had an incident with a customer trying to steal from us.

The customer came in, grabbed a few items, and tried to make a run for it without paying. I shouted at them to stop, but they kept running. I chased after them and eventually caught up with them.

When I confronted them, they tried to deny it, but I had seen them take the items. I asked them to put the items back and pay for them, but they refused.

At that point, I had to call the police. The customer was so embarrassed that they quickly put the items back and paid for them.

The moral of the story: don't steal, you'll only embarrass yourself.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/TalesFromRetail with title ""don't steal, you'll only embarrass yourself.""","When I was a young and stupid kid, this happened to me.

Hey everyone, 

I just wanted to share a piece of advice I've learned over the years: invest in stuff, sell stuff. When it comes to making money, it's a lot easier to make money when you buy something and then sell it for more than you paid for it. You can do this with stocks, real estate, businesses, or even collectibles. 

It's a great way to make some extra money, and you can even turn it into a full-time job if you're good at it. I know it's worked for me and it can work for you too. 

Thanks for reading and happy investing!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/mildlyinteresting with title ""Invest in stuff, sell stuff.""","I got about 3.5 mill in one year, without playing many games.

**Looks Can Be Deceiving**

I've been playing The WarZ for a few weeks now, and I've noticed something interesting. I've seen players who don't look like they would be good at the game, but they end up being really skilled and successful. On the other hand, I've seen players who look like they should be good at the game, but they end up being really bad. 

It just goes to show that looks can be deceiving. You can't judge a book by its cover, and you can't judge a player by their appearance. You never know what someone is capable of until you see them in action.

Hey everyone,

If you're considering transferring to UC Berkeley, I suggest you get in contact with the Transfer Student Resource Program (TRSP). It's a great way to get the information you need to make sure you meet all the requirements for transferring. Make sure you talk to a counselor and pay attention to what classes you need to take.

Also, don't forget to kick ass in your community college classes for two years. It may seem daunting, but getting a 4.0 GPA is not impossible, and might even be easy if you put in the effort.

Finally, make sure you apply to Cal and wait for your acceptance letter.

Good luck and I hope you get accepted!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/berkeley with title ""Contact  TRSP , be proactive with the necessary requirements (talk with a counselor, and make sure you pay attention to what classes you need to take, etc), kick ass in CC for 2 years (4.0 is not impossible, might even be easy), apply to Cal, wait for acceptance.""","First off, thank you Snaphooked for all you've done for us. I don't think there's anything we can do or say to fully express our gratitude for what all you and your military brethren have done and sacrificed for us. 

Anyway, to try and answer your question, you can try contacting [TRSP]( I know they have helped many veterans with their transfer plans, and have also helped in veterans transition into Berkeley/college life. Also, they can help you get into contact with other veterans who may volunteer to mentor you through the process. So I suggest contacting them first. 

As a transfer student, I've met many in CC and at Cal who've done the CC to UC transfer route (as many have already stated). I don't know of any who've gone straight to a UC after their service, but I'm sure it's possible. I recommend going to any CA CC and transfer. Sure, it'll take a good 2 years to do so, but you save so much in costs, not just in tuition, but also for living arrangements. Additionally, if you're not originally a CA resident, attending a CA CC will give you time to establish residency (this will reduce tuition costs significantly, just in case the GI Bill doesn't cover 100%).

Additionally, some CCs have transfer agreements with Cal (mostly in Northern CA). Basically, you're ""accepted"", but just have to fulfill your necessary requirements (ie. core courses, GPA, etc). Note, that not *all* CCs have this program. Different CCs have agreements with different UCs. But just because the CC of your choice doesn't have a transfer agreement program with Cal, doesn't mean you can't apply to or attend Cal. My CC didn't and I had no problem. 

One word of caution, Berkeley has different requirements than all the other UCs. So just because you fulfill your requirements for all the other UCs does not mean you fulfilled the requirements for Berkeley (I learned this the hard way). 

Sorry for the wall-o-text. If there's anything else you'd like to know, feel free to PM me. And best of luck to you :D

TL;DR: Contact [TRSP]( choose a CC (with or without a transfer agreement), be proactive with the necessary requirements (talk with a counselor, and make sure you pay attention to what classes you need to take, etc), kick ass in CC for 2 years (4.0 is not impossible, might even be easy), apply to Cal, wait for acceptance.

It's easy to think that you need to lose weight when you look in the mirror and see a large chest. But it's important to remember that it's most likely just surface fat or you naturally just have a large chest. It's important to remember that everyone is different and that your body is unique. Don't be too hard on yourself and remember to focus on taking small steps to reach your goals.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/loseit with title ""It's most likely just surface fat or you naturally just have a large chest.""","This is gonna be a bit long, but I'm seeing a lot of pseudoscientific speculation in the comments so I'll set it out for you like this.

It's possible that visceral (internal) fat is partly responsible for your large lower chest circumference, but not very likely. At the level that would affect the ribs at all you have the liver, the stomach, pancreas, and gall bladder. Of those, your liver is the one most likely to increase in size due to extra fat. 

Your ribcage can expand and shrink as well to a slight degree. The bones themselves won't change, but you can slightly stretch the cartilage, moreso at the level of the lower ribs because there is a lot more cartilage reaching from the sternum to span the distance to the ribs.

With both of those things in mind, your liver won't get *that* much bigger, I'm just estimating here, but I doubt you would get more than an inch, *maybe* two of rib circumference from a large fatty liver. The much more likely case is that there's just more subcutaneous (surface) fat than you think.

As far as lung size, the overall size of the lungs doesn't change in response to asthma, or really anything for that matter. They aren't the type of organs where physically getting bigger would help, they would need to develop new passageways and alveoli to increase surface area for oxygen exchange, which isn't something that happens. Also, your intercostal muscles which help breathing when you're having an asthma attack may slightly increase in size, but they're basically paper thin to begin with, they aren't going to affect anything noticeably.

I'm sure many of you have heard of the myth that ribs don't move and that fat can't displace them from the inside. Well, I'm here to tell you that this is far from the truth! I recently lost a lot of weight and I noticed that my ribs were actually shifting around as I lost fat. It was a strange feeling, but it definitely happened. So if you're trying to lose weight, don't be afraid to push yourself and know that your ribs will move if you lose enough fat!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/loseit with title ""ribs do move and fat can displace them from the inside.""","It doesn't have anything to do with asthma, but I think you're onto something with the fat thing. I don't believe your ribs are as displaced as you think they are. Even though you can feel them, there is deceptively more fat on the outside than you would think. I know this from experience!

Also, you should take your own personal body image into consideration. How you see your body will always be different from reality. It doesn't matter what size, sex, or age you are. I also learned this first hand in a body awareness class (opera singer here). We did an exercise in which we draw a picture of our own body from memory. Then we share them with the class and stand in front of a full length mirror and compare how you view yourself to how others view you. Nice, healthy dose of reality.

There is a really amazing Body Mapping textbook I would recommend to anyone. It's geared towards singers, but it is tremendously insightful for anyone.

Hello everyone!

I'm a big fan of Minecraft and I'm looking for some advice. I'm in the process of building a huge castle and I'm having a bit of trouble with the layout. Does anyone have any tips or tricks they can share to help me out?

I recently came across two articles about the same topic. The titles were different, but the content of the articles were nearly identical in word count. It was obvious that one article was a copy of the other.

So my question to you is: how often do you come across this kind of thing when you're browsing the internet? Have you ever seen articles, posts, or other content that have been copied and pasted without any changes? What do you think of it? Do you think it's wrong to do this kind of thing?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""version were nearly identical in word count.

If you're looking for a board to ride around the city for cruising and transportation purposes, I would highly recommend getting a longboard over a mini cruiser or a nickel with mods. Longboards are generally more stable, have better grip and are more comfortable to ride. Plus, they look really cool. 

If you really like the aesthetics of the original Penny board, you can always customize it with some grip tape and new colors. That way, it will be more suitable for city riding and will look great too. 

In terms of sizing, if you're around 6 feet tall and 200 pounds, a Penny Nickel should be just fine. I'm 5 foot 9, 160 pounds and wear size 11, and my Torpedo is just fine under me. Just make sure to adjust the bushings to your weight and riding style. 

Good luck!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/longboarding with title ""youre better off getting a longboard. then a mini cruiser or nickel with mods.

OH BOY. mind if i ask what city? scout your planned route. how fucked are you in terms of cracks, loose gravel, braille bumps and pedestrians? 

now, do you think you can do that on 50mm whees and a short wheel base?

its totally possible with 70mm wheels and a short WB to demolish the city, i do it. but it takes some work, and with the money you pore into it youde be better off getting a long board from churchill. that way sidewalk conditions are no problem and you can even take it into 20- 30 mph traffic should you feel safe doing so.

THEN if you feel like you still want a mini cruiser, get the churchill PK or a kryptoncics torpedo (i suppose a discounted penny is fine) and read [this](

Hey everyone,

I know that the new champion, Senna, has been the topic of much debate. Many people have been critical of her design, her abilities, and the direction of the game. However, I think it's important to remember that we haven't seen her in action yet.

Sure, we have a general idea of what she can do, but until she actually goes live and we can play her in game, we won't know for sure how she plays out. So before we start hating on something we haven't seen, let's wait and see how she plays out. Who knows, she might end up being an awesome champion!

Thanks for reading,

-Reddit User","give me the text of a reddit post from r/leagueoflegends with title ""Don't hate on something we have yet to see go live.""","I really think people need to calm down calling this change a horrible/stupid mistake on riot's end. I feel this is a change that will work out better in the long run. 

Honestly, they want to make the game less farm oriented for laners but more about having choices. I wanna see more people roaming and getting kills and taking advantage of that AFK farming Karthus/Anivia/Zyra. I hate seeing pure farm lanes. 

This will also allow more interaction between the lanes and greater emphasis on dragon control, and with a lot of the new jungler items we could see a lot more crazy things coming out from teams b/c of a change in gold income for laners.

TL;DR Don't hate on something we have yet to see go live."

As a long-time League of Legends player, I have to say that Riot's recent policy of changing the year of birth for players is a terrible idea. Even if it was a good policy (which it isn't), changing the year of birth would be a massive disadvantage to players who are already established in the game. It would be like starting from scratch and having to grind your way back up. No one wants to do that. So, in conclusion, I think Riot should reconsider this policy and find a better way to ensure the safety of their players. #changeyearofbirth=gg","give me the text of a reddit post from r/leagueoflegends with title ""Even if it was a good policy (which it isn't), change year of birth = gg""","there's no way to verify that somebody creating an account is a minor or not, plain and simple.

I can't remember if a date of birth was asked when creating a LoL account (it's been a long time since I created mine) but even so, whoever's below 18 (assuming that this policy is in place) would just change his year of birth. 

TL;DR 
Even if it was a good policy (which it isn't), change year of birth = gg"

GW2 has been a much better experience than WoW or Rift in terms of performance. The 'Ancient Karka' event was a great example of how GW2 is able to deliver a more stable, smooth and enjoyable experience than what Rift has been able to offer with its invasions. GW2 is a buy-to-play game and while there are still some issues to be ironed out, the overall performance is much better than what you'd find in a free-to-play game like Rift.

Rift's expansion and subscription prices aren't cheap either. You're looking at around $35 for the expansion and $10-$15 for the subscription. And yet, despite the cost, the performance issues remain. There's no new race or class, just a soul for each class, and the balance in PvE and PvP is far from ideal. Patches come with as many bugs as WoW or GW2.

In comparison, GW2 is a much better value for money and a much more enjoyable experience.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Guildwars2 with title ""GW2>WoW>Rift on performance.

There was so much lag that Lost Shores opening event with 100s of people and 1min lag seemed smooth as butter compared to a 3am Ember Isle event during the first week. And, Rift has a PTS and a sub to fix problems like this. If you need a reminder go check the forums.

Rift's performance is so bad that in a crowded city most of the time you can't see other players. In LA that happens during events when everyone gathers in one place, not every normal day.

The invasions in Rift are a joke. The bigger zerg wins. If you have enough players mobs don't matter. Most of the time you don't have time to hit an idol or a mini-boss before it goes down. Many times the players who do all the work can't get to the last boss on the other side of the map before it's dead. There aren't any side-objectives that matter apart from a couple of events in which you have to gather resources or escort a slow moving caravan. The rest can be zerged. Only lag can kill you, not even elite mobs.

The 'Ancient Karka' event was epic. For the first time a zerg could be defeated and playing smart to be able to survive and rez others was the best tactic. It had as much strategy requirement as you can expect in a non-instanced pug DE. And, Anet can't and should not try to fight stupidity. If you play the game for rewards, I don't care if you miss the event and just play 20mins to get them. I enjoy the game and get loot, you just get the loot. We are free people who bought their game and we can play it the way we like, as long as we don't exploit it or grief others.

Grandma's house was always the place to go for a refreshing childhood treat. Every time I visited, I knew I could count on a cold glass of spearmint soda.

I had a co-worker who was the most inept cellphone sales rep I've ever worked with. She was constantly making mistakes and not listening to customers, and yet somehow managed to stay employed. She was transferred to two different stores, and neither one liked her stupid shit, but still she wasn't fired. I guess you could say she was the luckiest person in the world!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/TalesFromRetail with title ""Had a co-worker; even though she was  the  most inept cellphone sales rep I've ever worked with, transferred stores twice because neither store liked her stupid shit, still not fired.""","I feel compelled to share about an ex coworker. We'll call her Stoopid. 

Stoopid worked at another location. Nobody at that location liked her. When management changed up at my location (good boss, I miss him), his last act was to finally approve her transfer over to our store (because she did not fit in with her work mates there and basically begged to come to our store). She got made fun of for the same stupid shit. 

This store I speak of was a cellphone store. She didn't know anything about cellphones (ok, ok, a lot of cellphone reps don't know much beyond what the cue card listed, but her stupidity went beyond that). 

I remember when the iPhone came out, one particular transaction went something like this:
She activated the customer on the computer (hour long process because even after 2 years of doing it she still sucked), sold them the phone, and the final step was to pop the sim card into the phone, and power it on, demo it to the customer and out the door).

Now, to be qualified to sell iPhones at our store, *everyone* had to go to training. She did as well. 

* Stoopid takes iPhone out of the box
* Stoopid takes SIM card out of packaging
* Stoopid looks all over the phone, and stares at it for a few minutes
* ""Where does the SIM card go"", she says aloud
* I'm looking over at her every once in a while from another station, while dealing with my own customer
* ""Oh there it is""
* Pops the SIM tray opener in the pin hole next to the earphone jack and takes out the tray
* Proceeds to shove the SIM card (backwards) into the slot..with the SIM tray on the table
* Me: *[Facepalm](
* She just added another hour to her transaction as she voided that one, and started anew with another phone for the customer

Other shit she pulled was accept phones back way beyond the return window of allowed phone returns (ie. way more - triple - the allowed talk time on the phone), phones damaged (ie. scuffs and dings in the phone), missing accessories, missing *phones*, phones not matching IMEIs (ie. not the same phone as was on the receipt, same make/model, but not the same phone). She fudged so many people's accounts it's not even funny. I, and the others would make her call in our retail support line and fix her shit. This unfortunately meant the customer had to stay longer in the store, but I didn't think it fair they suffer for her ignorant and appalling behavior. Also, I didn't want to get yelled at when the customer came in the next day/week/month asking wtf is going on with their plan because Stoopid fucked up.

Stoopid eventually went back to her old store when she clued in she wasn't getting any help from any of us anymore. I, most of all hoped she's quit working tech, but instead went back to her old store where management changed up there too, and new round of employees. Disappointed she was still selling phones, glad she wasn't screwing shit up at our store anymore.

A couple years later (after quitting) I was at her location returning some TV equipment (store got upgraded to include returns of other products). I had to help her return the thing I brought back despite not having seen or used the computers in a long time, despite not even looking at the screen while she was clicking on shit. A computer system she uses day in and day out. 

* ""Do this, Stoopid""
* ""Hang on, I think if I click here it'll work""
* ""No, it won't work like that you'll get an error""
* ""Everything looks right, ... oh.. I got an error""
* ""Just do it exactly like I said, stop screwing around"" *touching the screen in the spots she had to click things, without seeing anything from my point of view*
* ""Oh, it worked now""
* Me: fuckyea.jpg


**TL;DR**

Had a co-worker; even though she was *the* most inept cellphone sales rep I've ever worked with, transferred stores twice because neither store liked her stupid shit, still not fired.

Hey everyone,

I think this whole issue can be solved with some enforced publicly known rules. The rules should be enforced by the CivCraft moderators and should be made known to the entire server. This would help with enforcing the rules and making sure everyone is on the same page.

The rules should be clear, concise, and easy to understand. They should cover all aspects of the game, including but not limited to: griefing, raiding, stealing, and trading. All of these should be addressed in the rules and punishments should be clearly stated for those who break them.

This would help ensure that everyone is playing by the same rules and would help reduce the amount of conflicts that arise on the server.

What do you think? Do you think this would be a good solution to the current issues?

Let me know your thoughts!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Civcraft with title ""I think this whole issue can be solved with some enforced publicly known rules""","&gt;Furthermore the Mumble is a courtesy and as I have said before it does not fall under the same rules as the subreddit or the server. If you are banned from the subreddit there really is no way to complain, if you are banned from mumble the result is almost nil. You are still fully capable of acting and complaining on the server and within the servers community. 

According to the admission of exultant and and other members of the CKC the server's culture is on mumble, furthermore users are encouraged to use it as global chat. to cut the user of from mumble is to forcibly remove a form of communication from them, and cut them off from a section of the community.

However I think the problem is no rules were ever declared for the mumble. why not put in place a similar rule to the sub reddit, in that you cant make channels with raciest names and what not. in addition maybe a warning could be sent to the owner of the channel giving them a warning. after this if they continue to break the rules ban them. If you did this, you could point to the rules, and take action, and most of the community would be accepting of it as ODJ knew the consequences of his actions. Which I feel action was justified in OJD's case, however I am aware how difficult it can be to talk with exultant and can understand the reaction of the community. if there are rules like that perhaps making a way for us to be more publicly aware of them is in order, as have not yet scene them.

tl;dr: I think this whole issue can be solved with some enforced publicly known rules"

Caution: Spoiler warning!

**Twilight**: Girl falls in love with a vampire whose coven abstains from human blood. Her blood is particularly tempting to him, so every moment they spend together puts him in great pain and her in great danger. When a passing vampire decides to use Bella for a sadistic game, he convinces her he's kidnapped her mother and she goes willingly to him. He starts beating her up by throwing her around in a ballet studio and bites her, only to be saved at the last minute by Edward and his family. Edward sucks the venom out so he doesn't condemn her to immortality. Oh, and he can read minds but not hers and their first date is a result of him saving her from rapists.

**New Moon**: We learn that her best friend Jacob is a werewolf and that the shape-shifting of his tribe stems from an ancient rivalry between his tribe and the vampires, though they have a treaty with the Cullens. In an effort to keep her safe from potential danger of vampires Edward leaves, and Jacob becomes her rock through the ensuing depression. Bella starts taking risks to get an adrenaline rush and ""see"" Edward. When she jumps off a cliff for that reason, his future-seeing seeing sister believes she has killed herself. Bella must fly to Italy and stop him from stepping into the sun so that he will be killed but the ""kings"" of the vampire world, a cult-like ancient group called the Volturi. Edward then returns with Bella so as not to lose her again.

**Eclipse**: The sadistic vampire that Edward killed in the first book had a mate, who has been creating an army of volatile newborn vampires in Seattle to come and kill Bella to avenge her mate. The Cullens have an uneasy alliance with the werewolves to protect her, and the Volturi allow the army to come. We learn about their political motivation and their desire to take the super-powered Cullens and use them for further control. The newborn army is defeated and Bella cuts herself to distract Victoria (the vamp girlfriend) so that Edward can defeat her. Not even getting into the love triangle between Jacob, Bella, and Edward.

**Breaking Dawn**: They get married and she experiences a hyperspeed pregnancy where the incompatible fetus is draining the nutrition from her body, forcing her to drink blood to sustain herself. The baby kills her during birth, but she is saved at the last minute by Edward's venom. Believing that the child is an ""immortal child"" (dangerous vampires that stay children and are killed on sight) rather than a half-vampire child, the Volturi are coming to slaughter the Cullens. They must gather witnesses to make the Volturi hear them out: vampire friends from all over the word. An Egyptian coven brings someone who can manipulate the elements, amazonian vampires with someone who can change what you see, fellow ""vegetarian vampires"" have someone that can physically shock you, Jasper brings friends from his days in the Civil War but he and Alice mysteriously disappear, and nomadic vampires from all over join them. All of *that* is compounded by the fear of the child's speedy growth and the lack of information on her future, which Alice can not see. There is a final standoff that I don't want to spoil.

All of the Cullens have interesting and dynamic back stories, and so do some of the werewolves. With a strong female lead and a better author, Twilight could have been fucking awesome.

It's been a few months since news broke about Kevin Clash, the former puppeteer for Sesame Street's Elmo character, and the allegations of underage relationships. Though the case was settled out of court, Clash has now resigned from Sesame Street. 

It's unclear why Clash chose to settle and resign, but it's likely that he was looking to avoid a lengthy and costly court battle. It's possible that the settlement was a way for Clash to put the issue behind him and move on with his life. 

What's clear is that the allegations against Clash have been a huge blow to Sesame Street, a beloved children's show. It's understandable why the show's producers wanted to put the scandal behind them as quickly as possible, and settling the case and having Clash resign was the best way to do that. 

It's a sad situation all around, but hopefully this will be the end of the story and Sesame Street can move on and continue to bring joy to children all over the world.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/entertainment with title ""Kevin Clash settled AND resigned  for a reason .""","No. I've stated from the beginning that I believe Clash has a share of the blame here. Whether he's 1% or 100% at fault. All I ask is for people to consider the facts which DO point to him having at least some share of the blame.


It's the total ignorance of those jumping on the bandwagon to fully support him that's sad. Just because he's a celebrity.


As a celebrity, you DO NOT publicly settle like this. I firmly believe this second accuser is being an opportunist, BUT for Kevin to settle in the first place and then resign immediately after the second accuser gives a lot of merit to their claims!


The second accuser very well may have had underage sex with Clash, but I doubt that if he did he was ever ""troubled"" by it. 


I believe Clash's willingness to first settle, then resign, means to me that there is incriminating evidence somewhere, and possibly MORE accusers that will be coming forward.


If you were 100% innocent in the first place, WHY settle when *as a celebrity* you are inviting copycat accusers?

It's been a few days since the news of the allegations against Clash broke and the silence from him has been deafening. He has yet to make any comment on the matter and has stayed out of the public eye.

This silence is only making things worse for Clash as it gives the impression that he is guilty of the accusations made against him. Not only is he not denying the accusations, he is not even addressing them at all.

Clash himself is the only one giving these accusers any credibility through his actions, which on the surface appear very guilty. This could be a huge mistake on his part and could have a disastrous effect on his career.

It's time for Clash to come out and address these allegations. If he is innocent, he needs to prove it. If not, he needs to accept the consequences and move on. Either way, the sooner he speaks out, the better it will be for him and everyone involved.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/entertainment with title ""Clash himself is the only one giving these accusers any credibility through his actions, which on the surface appear very guilty.""","What would *you* do?


What would any of us do?


What would a celebrity do, who has access to top lawyers and publicists?


Any publicist worth a damn would have advised him NOT to settle *after the first accusation was made public*. As a celebrity, maybe it would have been worthwhile to settle *before* it became public to prevent anyone from talking to the press, just to prevent a PR nightmare. That stuff happens all the time, especially with celebrity divorces and things not involving these current allegations.


BUT, once this shit was made public, any publicist or lawyer would have advised NOT to settle if you were innocent, because it gives your public accuser credibility.


Now this second accuser comes along, which again any lawyer or publicist for someone famous and with lots of money would have expected. ""Hey, this rich guy is giving out free money!"" And copy-cats come out of the woodwork.


How does Clash respond?


He *resigns*.


Makes you wonder what evidence is out there, how many more accusers will come forth, etc. You might have 100 accusers come forth now, with 99 of them *lying through their teeth*. All it takes is just one with some evidence. 


Which is why *if* Clash were 100% innocent, he should have never settled in the first place.

There is no hesitation or fear WHATSOEVER on either of our parts to say what we're thinking or what needs to be said. There is nothing worse for a relationship than wondering if you're ""allowed"" to say this  or that, for fear of crossing some line or causing offense. Neither of us do that. Ever. 

All that communication has resulted in a deep and profound level of TRUST. And in that trust, she submits to me (almost) completely and utterly. 

I am so fucking lucky, I dont even know what to do with myself. To be submitted to and (even better) LOVED by one such as her makes me so very happy.

Hey everyone,

I'm sure a lot of us have been in the situation where we feel like we have to win a certain number of games in a set or hit a certain MMR to feel successful. I'm here to say that it's time to throw away those arbitrary goals and set our own!

Playing Dota is supposed to be fun, and if we're constantly stressing ourselves out to hit a certain goal, we're missing out on the joy of the game. So why not set your own goals? Maybe it's to learn a new hero, or master a certain skill, or just play for fun. Whatever it is, make sure it's something that will make you happy and excited to play.

So go ahead and fuck the match point. Set your own goals and enjoy the game!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/DotA2 with title ""fuck the match point set your own goals""","I rage all the time.  It's part of the process.  I've gotten really good at not showing it in game even if someone else is because I found if I at least ignore where my rage is targeted we can get over faster as a team and finish the game with a better chance of a win.

When I'm raging because of a troll rager I bottle it up for a special day where I social engineer their residence and then plan my next trip that goes by them accordingly.   I give myself a good two days maybe three to case their place and prepare.  Before I ditch I break in silently and kill them then disappear.  It helps me actually stand the ragers knowing I will kill them.  Not like valve does shit about people telling others to kill themselves and whatnot.  Gotta take punishment into my own hands if they ain't doin shit.

Joking aside mute button and play my shit is what I do.  Teammate fucked up?  Not like I haven't!  Also people get mad about the time they ""invest"" going to a loss.  You're gunna play tons more games so what design one hour mean?

Hey everyone,

I know it's easy to get stuck in a rut when it comes to playing games, especially if you're a fan of competitive games like Dota 2. I'm sure many of you have been playing for hours on end, and it's easy to get burned out.

So my advice is to take a break and play something else for awhile. It doesn't have to be something completely different, but it could be a different genre of game. Maybe something like a puzzle game or a story-driven game.

It's important to give yourself a break and come back to the game with fresh eyes. You'll find that it'll be more enjoyable, and you'll be able to play better when you come back.

Thanks for reading, and happy gaming!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/DotA2 with title ""Take a break, play something else for awhile.""","Stop playing.  Seriously, take a break for awhile and come back with a fresh mind.  I very rarely rage when I game, but for some reason, FIFA on 360 has cost me several controllers and headsets...even up to the point where I had thrown my actual console across the room.  Yeah.

I come from a very competitive background including playing professionally for a short stint (BF2), so I can understand getting frustrated when yourself or someone on your team performs far less than desirable.  Honestly, once you get to the point where you're constantly raging, there is no point in playing.  For one, no matter what you do, you aren't going to find enjoyment in playing.  Secondly, as mentioned already, when you rage, one typically plays worse and makes stupid mistakes which only induce even more rage.

So, back to the original statement.  When I would find myself getting overly irritated with FIFA, I would take a break ranging from a couple days up to a few weeks.  That typically allowed me to come back and enjoy myself again, and I usually played significantly better when I would come back too.

If it's the language barrier that is driving you crazy (which I really don't think that is the overlying issue), then find a few friends to queue up with.

Are we being over charged to be over educated for too long with knowledge we neither want nor need?

It's a question that has been asked by many Australians in recent years. With the cost of university tuition fees and the length of time it takes to complete a degree, it's no wonder why people are questioning the value of their education.

The cost of higher education in Australia is on the rise, with the average student graduating with around $30,000 in debt. This is a significant amount of money for someone just starting out in life. On top of this, the length of time it takes to complete a degree can be daunting for some.

At the same time, there are many students who feel they are being taught too much information that they don't need or want to know. This can lead to frustration and a feeling of wasted time and money.

So, are we being over charged to be over educated for too long with knowledge we neither want nor need? It's a difficult question to answer, as everyone's educational needs and goals are different. However, it's important to consider the cost of education and the value of the knowledge you are gaining.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/australia with title ""Are we being over charged to be over educated for too long with knowledge we neither want nor need?""","&gt; The only 'gangs' I grew up around just skated/rode bikes/graffiti'd shit. 

Hey. That was me. Here's where I go against the grain...

I honestly think I could have jumped from High School around year 8 to a degree in I.T., which could have been completed in two years instead of three. I propose that a lot of other people could have done similar, and we all wasted a lot of our time.

If forced to explain or illustrate what I learnt at High School I'd be hard pressed to fill two minutes. Perhaps I was bored but in the end I ended up dropping out and joining these dangerous ""gangs"". I had the best time of my life.

Even in software development I don't use anything more than primary school mathematics. Granted the logic can become ridiculously complicated, even just the interaction between layers, but there's *nothing taught at school that's even remotely similar*. It's all self taught/learned on the job. Actually I classify I.T. as a modern trade.

On second thoughts starting work at 8 is ridiculous (personally I start at 9.30), but earlier than 16 is really worth thinking about. There are certainly friends that were terrible at school, finished as soon as they could, learnt a trade, and now run their own, very successful business. Perhaps they could have left even earlier with negligible difference. I'm sure I could have left earlier and started making money earlier, bought a house before 2000 and so on.

(edit: as for education I value it highly, but I've learned more after school. My own wandering through Wikipedia, documentaries, short courses at uni and the like I've done simply *for the sake of* and enjoyment of education. Things I wanted to learn that I was interested in and did nothing for my career at all. Just for education's sake. &lt;/rant&gt;)

edit edit: education these days **IS BIG BUSINESS**. Do you need to spend ~$30K on a private school? Of course not. Who owns these schools anyway (nobody *ever* asks)? And university? These days it's a career machine, which has it's good points I'll grant. But there's a real onus on students as a customer, not a student. Make as much money as possible from them, especially the foreign ones. [UNSW pulled in $1b in revenue]( for example. I'm sure the others are similar. They all have a vested interest in over-educating you. In Germany it's all free.

Hey everyone, 

I know that it can be embarrassing to talk about sex-related issues, but I wanted to reassure anyone who might be feeling anxious about their fapping habits that it's perfectly normal. It's a natural way to explore your sexuality and have some fun.

That said, if you're worried about any potential health risks, it's always a good idea to get tested - just to set your mind at ease.

Thanks for reading and happy fapping!

First times are usually a bit rough, and an experienced partner will--or at least should--be understanding of any fumbles you make because they've most likely been there themselves, in one way or another. Less-than-excellent performance the first time (or several times) is not merely okay, it's to be expected. Don't equate yourself with your performance the first time you have sex.

As for the lack of protection thing, my general sense is that's generally an unwise thing to do outside of a monogamous relationship, even if she is, or claims to be, on the pill. So I'd say avoid doing it in the future, though the odds are you'll get away with doing it just once. (They  do make larger condoms if endowment's the issue there.) If you're still preoccupied by the risk, getting tested is probably the best way to set your mind at rest.

As for this nonsense in the other comments, at least if my own experience is any guide, you'd have to be fapping a *lot* more than once a day for it to impact your sex life negatively. I suspect the problem with being able to get it up was more ""performance anxiety"" than anything else--which, as I said, is normal and to be expected.

I can totally relate to your situation. I had the same thing happen to me when I was younger. It was really disappointing and made me feel like I wasn't cut out for sex. 

But don't get too depressed about it. The first time is usually bad for most guys, and it takes some practice to get it right. Just try it again and you'll be fine. You might cum quickly, but if you keep at it during the same session you'll more than likely have great sex.

Luckily, at that age you have two things going for you:
  
  * If they it's your first time you're almost expected to cum quickly.

I picked up a slide, stopped using a pick (for blues) and learned a few basic turnarounds. there are a few songs that are fairly easy to learn I started with You got to move, Becks version of He's a mighty fine leader and though I know its not exactly blues but Wild horses, it is a great open G song, that shows how to do open chords in G tuning. the rest is just time and fooling around.

If we treated religion like we do science (STOP thinking I'm saying religion is just like science.  I know you are), we'd blame the church, the pastors, the people involved AND the Pope would have to defend his church's protection of child abusers.   Instead, we have allowed religion to be considered ""special"".  It is tax exempt, and considered above reproach in many circles.  WE did this, not religion, and not science.  Don't blame the religion (which contradicts itself often enough to show you AREN'T supposed to take it literally).  Blame the selfish people who use it to create the very abuses you hate.

TL;DR Stop blaming the religion and get back to bling the people levering it as an excuse to defend their actions or gain power over others.

This post is about my experience with smoking for the first time. I was so anxious, I thought I was going to have a panic attack. I was so scared of doing something wrong, or not understanding what I was doing. But, after a while, I figured it out. It took a lot of 'soul searching' to get to that point, but I eventually got there. 

I know it can be really hard to get through the anxiety and fear that comes with trying something new, especially something like smoking. I can tell you from experience that it does get easier. As you learn more about yourself, you will be able to handle things better. 

I hope this post can help someone else who is going through the same thing. All I can say is, don't give up! You can do it, and it will get easier. Just take it one step at a time.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/trees with title ""First time smoking, I freaked out pretty bad, had super anxiety... in the end figured my shit out though. It just takes some 'soul searching' 
 EDIT: OP, or anybody else in this thread for that matter, take my story with a grain of salt. I still struggle with things from time to time, it just gets easier to deal with as time goes on, and you learn yourself. If that makes any sense.""","It gets easier man, its not as mentally exhausting as you seem to be portraying. The first time I smoked I had an anxiety attack, it was horrible.. rapid heart beat, racing thoughts, increased breathing, then as I was hyper ventilating I started to black out, luckily I sat down and did not pass out.

I assumed it was laced, I felt as if I was going to die right here, right now. I considered how my un-being might effect the world, or the people I love. I convinced myself I was dying, pure terror, but eventually came down and realized I wasn't going to die.

This experience totally threw me off of my cannabis exploration at the time, I swore off the drug and said I would never use it again. The symptoms persisted seemingly at random, however, this all happened at a very unstable part of my life. Before trying cannabis I was lying through my face to my parents, failing out of high school, playing video games, and just generally doing nothing.

After I tried cannabis, it forced my brain to start problem solving sub-consciously. Started thinking about all the things, that made me scared or paranoid. Though at the time I didn't know why the symptoms were occurring, I, like you, was constantly mentally exhausted. I attended counselling, but still felt symptoms of angst.

My symptoms would show up randomly, but I grew as a person from them... after hours of 'soul searching', I identified consciously what my fears were, and how to concur them. I realized that I was afraid of a lot of things. Too many things, but began to find solitude in the idea, that, I am not my body, and life or death, I will always be.

All that to say, don't get sucked into the pop-cult ways that describe your feelings as a ""mental illness"", or how you put it you have ""anxiety"", as if it could be cured with some press of chemicals that come out of their capitalistic death machines. Its all about your outlook on the world, and more importantly YOUR mind set...

Now, I cant fix this for you. You have to become really introspective, set time aside, to think about the things that could have triggered your specific reaction. Because, trust me... these feelings aren't random, you do have a trigger.

Smoking cannabis for the first time, this experience couldn't have helped me more in my life, and I truly do look at as a blessing. In the end, It made me a happier person, and I continue to use cannabis regularly (with a more stable mindset) and I haven't had a panic episode in more than two years.

TL;DR - First time smoking, I freaked out pretty bad, had super anxiety... in the end figured my shit out though. It just takes some 'soul searching'

EDIT: OP, or anybody else in this thread for that matter, take my story with a grain of salt. I still struggle with things from time to time, it just gets easier to deal with as time goes on, and you learn yourself. If that makes any sense."

Hey everyone,

I'm new to the subreddit and I wanted to share something with you all. I recently read an article about the benefits of trees and how they can help us in so many ways. It really made me think about how important trees are to our environment and how we can all do our part to help them. 

After reading the article, I decided to take a walk in the woods and just take in the beauty of the trees around me. I was amazed at how calming it was and how it made me feel. It was an amazing experience and it really opened my eyes to the importance of trees. 

It took me almost an hour and a half to read the article and take my walk in the woods, but it was worth it. I hope this post inspires you to take some time to appreciate the trees around you and to think about how you can help them. 

Thanks for reading!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/trees with title ""Read my post it took me almost an hour and a half.""","It's the weed you are smoking my friend. Unfortunately, we live in a time in which marijuana is no longer a ""safe"" drug, a byproduct stemming from the decontrol and deregulation of the substance. Don't get me wrong, untainted marijuana has a plethora of beneficial effects (although it is certainly not without its faults) which, unabused and used within reason, is much safer than rivaling alcohol and makes most harder drugs look like trucker crack. But the disconcerting truth is that when it comes down to it, you don't really know for certain that you are only smoking marijuana. Sure, its a plant: it's dry, sticky, leafy with an abundance of buds, caked in trichomes. But even if it fits that description, how can you be certain that it is simply marijuana? There are just too many unknown factors and variables that come into play, which the user often has no control of unless he/she is also a producer. What kind of soil is used? Was a special fertilizer employed during the growing? In what environment was the plant raised? Had the grower found it necessary to use chemicals such as pesticides to protect his/her crops, perhaps to increase his/her yield?  And the only standard that we can put any trust in (other than our own opinions) is the word of our dealers, who really don't know squat about what they are passing on, other than the words of their dealers and their own naivety. It is ironic in a sense, because we live in a world where, depending on your location, most have incredibly easy access to the plant which gives it the illusion that it is a plentiful substance. Indeed, it is easier for most highschoolers who are looking to experiment to grab a sack off a buddy than it is to find a boot. But that couldn't be farther from the truth. In fact, finding unaltered marijuana can prove to be quite a time consuming chore, impossible for some who do not possess the right connections. 

I have encountered many of the side effects you have described, and numerous others that you are lucky to have evaded (or maybe just too shy or uncertain to post about). Lets just say that, while completely blown out of proportion, South Park's ""Medicinal Fried Chicken"" episode wasn't too far off the mark. And there is a reason Karl from Workaholics (the drug dealer if you are unfamiliar) has one lazy eye. My advice to you, and anyone else in a similar situation, is to abstain for now, for your body's sake. If you do want to keep smoking, try to find a way to get your herb directly from the source, and I'm not talking dispensaries (I am in no way suggesting you should start growing your own, there is enough of that on these boards it seems).  Don't get me wrong, this is no small task, an undertaking I am currently on myself. But it really is the only way to insure your own safety, which should be priority #1 for anyone in the right mind. 

I mentioned chemicals earlier in my post, and while I may have no proof, I do believe they are the culprit. There seems to be a particular smell on a lot of the stuff I have access to these days, I don't know quite how to describe it other than something is just off. If you have ever smoked the Blue Cheese strain, that is the scent it closely resembles to me, except now I find it on indicas and sativas alike. By contrast, I have friends who still can get ""pure"" stuff that doesn't smell like anything other than plain ganj, which is a welcome scent compared to the sickening alternative. I have heard, among other things, that these days some herb gets sprayed with who knows what, purely to add weight to the batch. But my gut instinct tells me that something far more sinister is at play, for it seems unlikely that it is merely coincidence that I have exhibited symptoms that are satired on the likes of a show such as South Park. 

Sometimes I genuinely worry about the toker demographic, specially the youngens who are just starting to get into this game, who don't know any better and will keep smoking the illegitimate weed. A part of me wanted to make my own post to try to get my experiences out there as a public service announcement, but this thread seems like a good place to start. Lets try to bump this so that we can educate those who may not know the possible harm they might be doing to their bodies. Stay safe fellow ents, there is nothing more important in this life than your health.

TLDR: Read my post it took me almost an hour and a half."

Hey everyone! 

If you're looking to improve your overall wellbeing and find true happiness, then meditation is the way to go. It's something that can help you reach a baseline level of functionality, stability, and health, and if you want to go beyond that, it can help you reach a level of self-perfection, universal wisdom, and complete happiness. 

Before you start an intensive meditation practice, it's important to get all the other stuff in your life in line - make sure you're eating right, getting enough sleep, exercising, and managing stress. Once you have that all taken care of, you can begin your meditation practice. 

Good luck!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Meditation with title ""If you want to retain a baseline level of functionality, stability, and health, there are better things to invest your time in than meditation. If you want to go beyond, and are interested in self-perfection, universal wisdom and complete happiness, then get all that other stuff in line and begin an intensive meditation practice. 
 Good luck!""","There are many different spheres of health: physio-energetic, mental, emotional, interpersonal, and transpersonal (spiritual). Your problem is bound up to one degree or another with each of these categories. 

Meditation will have a positive effect on all facets of health. The thing is, though, that for most of these areas (physio-energetic, mental, emotional, and interpersonal), there are practices that are much more effective and efficient than meditation. For physical health, exercise and diet are essential, and for maximal benefit I'd recommend an energetic practice like yoga or chi kung. For mental health, reading and writing are great (calm-concentration style meditation is quite beneficial here as well). For emotional health, good psychotherapy is invaluable. Interpersonal issues can be solved through greater efforts towards honesty, openness and healthy communication. 

Meditation is specifically geared towards transpersonal, or spiritual, health and growth. These words are rather woo-ey and don't sit well with many people, but it's quite practical actually: meditation prepares and engages your mind such that *insight* into the nature of the body-mind process is possible. In other words: meditation calms the body and mind so that it can investigate experience, and from that investigation develop an understanding of how experience works. It is ""transpersonal"" in the sense that the specific, personal *content* of experience is not what's important so much as the *formal properties* of experience in general. This is what meditation does best.

So, as I read it, the bulk of your problems are connected to a generally unhealthy lifestyle, and can be solved through efforts to improve all the mundane aspects of your health. If you do so, you will feel more functional and stable in all kinds of life circumstances.

Meditation is for those who are not satisfied with simply being functional and stable. The goal of meditation is insight into the nature of reality and the consequent attainment of unconditional, perfect happiness. Many people in the Western world do not get this and thus waste a lot of their time meditating for stress relief etc. when they could be getting a whole lot more out of tai chi or a good diet. Meditation is a whole different rabbit hole. 

tl;dr: If you want to retain a baseline level of functionality, stability, and health, there are better things to invest your time in than meditation. If you want to go beyond, and are interested in self-perfection, universal wisdom and complete happiness, then get all that other stuff in line and begin an intensive meditation practice. 

Good luck!

I recently did something I regret: I poured hot oil in my girlfriend's ear to cure her earache. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but I didn't realize how dangerous it was. She screamed in pain and I felt horrible. I knew I had to take her to the hospital right away, and thankfully she was okay.

I know this might sound crazy, but guys should really consider trying Viagra. I know it's usually associated with older men, but it can be really helpful for younger guys too. It doesn't leave you with a raging boner all the time, but it can help with erectile dysfunction and other issues. It's important to talk to your doctor before taking any kind of medication, so don't just order it on the internet. Viagra can be a great solution for guys that are struggling with their sexual performance.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""Viagra doesn't usually leave you with a raging boner all the time; Guys should try it (Talk to your doctor, no need to order on the internet)""","Firstly, I'm sorry for your loss.

Secondly, in case anyone cares, the uncontrollable erection is likely because OP took the whole pill. Generally speaking you need a sexual stimuli to achieve an erection on Viagra except at high dosages, or OP is young enough that he gets NRBs on the regular. 

I'm a young, healthy male in his early twenties who sometimes can't get an erection (a lifetime of cycling and a corrected circumcision will do that) and take Viagra for it. It leaves me pretty damn tumescent (think half to full chub) and lowers the threshold for achieving an erection, but by no means leaves me with a raging, mega-huge boner in public.

The dosage on Viagra is set so that the oldest, wrinkliest, softest old man with shit cardiovascular health can take his old lady for a ride on the pound town express all night long. It's so high that my doctor just gives me sample packs of four, which can then be split up into thirty-two separate doses.

Oh, and since this an off-topic reply already, **Guys, you gotta try this shit**. Next time you go to your doctor/internist just say you've had some trouble getting an erection. They'll ask you about stress, smoking, exercise, and masturbation habits, including what porn you watch (apparently unrealistic fetish porn can cause performance issues). If you're a healthy, well-adjusted adult and have a good relationship with your doctor (if you don't, why not?) they'll most likely gives you a sample pack.

There's minimal side-effects for healthy adults so they can be pretty loose about it. Across the pond they sold a beer celebrating the royal wedding with a hit of Viagra in it, to give you some idea of how safe it is. 

And for people thinking ""Psh, I don't need that"", you're right; you don't need it. But as every man knows, there's a fairly large range of boner quality (Think post-teenage masturbation marathon on the low end and morning wood on the high end). This'll give you the highest of high quality, for hours. Got whisky-dick? Go from trying to stuff an oyster into a parking meter to fucking like a porn star.

I recently agreed to hook a brother up with some headies in exchange for taking my slut away. Little did I know, he also wanted to get head as well. When he didn't show up, I had to become a pimp to get my slut a percocet. 

It was a scary experience, but it taught me a valuable lesson. Never make a deal with someone who doesn't follow through. Have you ever had a similar experience? How did you handle it?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""I took her away in exchange for agreeing to hook a brother up with headies. He came to get head as well. But he didn't come, so I had to become a pimp to get my slut a percocet.""","Ok, the extended version can be found here: 
This was the third of 4 ridiculous dates with this MILF, all of which are in the abandoned but awesome subreddit, /r/LastNight 

In short, there was a bouncer in front of the bathroom (protecting his friends or some shit). He made me agree to get him some headies (in the hood, they only smoke mids) later that night (""Hook me up"" were a sample of his exact words). I agreed, he let me in, my MILF and the dudes came out. I got her out of there.

So anyway, I'm lying to myself that I got her out before anything happened (well, maybe she snorted coke but maybe she didn't yet insert their cocks in her mouth). So I tell her to brush her teeth for five minutes and then we'll go at it. Luckily, she has one of those mom purses that had to have came out of Hogwarts because they fit so much  shit in them. She digs down and pulls out a toothbrush, and toothpaste. 

A few minutes later, she's naked on my bed when I get a call on my phone from the bathroom bouncer. He's at my door. I tell her to stay upstairs while I sell him the weed. Everything's good and dandy and he's about to leave when she comes downstairs in her underwear. She asks him if he has anything other than weed that can get her fucked up.

""All I got is this percocet 30""
""What would I have to do for it?""
""Suck my dick until it comes."" [**Public service announcement: This is the part where people who don't live in West Philadelphia stop believing. But I'm going to college and living on the borders of the hood. These are poor black families, almost entirely single mother and several children and many of the boys are on drugs or part of a group that sells them. They grow up without any male father figures so the older kids indoctrinate the young ones. This guy was one of the worst, a major cheapster mids slinger.**]

Then she asks, ""Do you have one for him?"" He says no and she agrees anyway. I wouldn't have taken it, but to relate it to the question prompt, she thought she was doing it at least a little for me.

So she takes him to my bathroom, and sucks his dick. I sort of stay neutral (I said, ""I don't endorse it, but if you want to be a slut, it's your call.""), and stay until her mouth is wrapped around his placid slim jim. 

30 minutes later, he calls me to come back. He says he didn't come so he's not giving her the percocet. So now I have to be a fucking pimp, and tell him, ""Look man, if you didn't come, that's your fault. My girl was on you for 30 minutes. She earned it.""

He's like, ""Sure, man, that's cool. You better have some good stuff here. I'll give you a call tomorrow for some more.""

""No way in hell, man."" I say, as he hands me the percocet.
   
""No hard feelings, bro."" He says, and walks out the door.

I've also been away from this for some time, but it's what I did my PhD work in.""","There is so much misinformation in this thread, I don't know who to reply to.  **nickfree, you are absolutely right.**  Ritalin (methylphenidate) is a stimulant.  It is thought to have its beneficial effects by helping ADHD/ADD suffers focus.  This might have a ""calming"" effect on their mood, their frustrations, etc., but it is not a depressant or anxiolytic (like, say, benzodiazepines).  

ADHD is not an excess or paucity of dopamine (as CODDE117 insinuates).  It is not dopamine-release seeking behavior.  It is a complex syndrome that may have different etiologies in different people.  However, to the extent that the ability to attend is deficient (the ""attention deficit"" part of the name), there are some pretty good theories about how that works.

Attending to something intentionally is a complex behavior carried out by the interaction of many systems and structures in the brain.  Of the structures involved, perhaps the most important (broadly speaking) is the prefrontal cortex which maintains current task context and ""set.""  This is the part of the brain that keeps ""in mind"" what you are trying to attend to.  Activity in this part of the brain helps direct other parts of the brain to emit behaviors consistent with keeping you on task.  I am very much oversimplifying things, but this is the general notion.

What is thought to break down in attentional deficit disorder is the mechanism that ""gates"" what gets *into* prefrontal cortex. ADD/ADHD sufferers (along with many other ""frontal"" patients that have trouble attending) tend to be labile and highly distractible.  Their minds jump around, they can't focus on one thing at a time, or their thoughts may race.  Paradoxically, these same sufferers sometimes find that they perseverate -- they get ""stuck"" on a train of thought or wrapped up in a task that may be a distraction or not what they ""ought"" to be attending to.

It's a bit much for a Reddit post to get into how a flaw in this context maintenance system can be both very labile and sticky.  To grossly oversimplify, it's that the signals that ""gate"" in new things to attend to are not timed well or strong enough, and the ""gates"" themselves may neurophysiologically ""swing"" too easily.   Two important neurotransmitters help determine what gets into prefrontal cortex and when: dopamine and norepinephrine.  Ritalin amplifies the effects of both of these neurotransmitters in the brain (through reuptake inhibition).

The tl;dr is this: Ritalin may help users attend my sharpening the signals that help the brain maintain attentional focus. I can go into this in more detail or point people to papers if they really want.  Note I more expert on the attentional systems of the brain itself than on ADHD/ADD as a disorder per se.

Don't do it! 

I know it's tempting to buy that new guitar you've been eyeing, but don't do it! You'll only be setting yourself up for disappointment and buyer's remorse. 

It's easy to get swept up in the excitement of buying something new. But, take a step back and think about it. Do you really need a new guitar? Do you have the money to spend? Do you have the time to learn a new instrument? 

If the answer to any of these questions is no, then don't do it. Save your money, and use it for something else. 

Thanks for listening!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Guitar with title ""Don't do it.""","**Everything about your guitar has an effect on the way it sounds.**

I don't recommend doing this, even if your guitar is a cheap copy. It will irreversibly change the way your guitar sounds.

Before you take those rather drastic measures, try *adjusting your strap*, and **work on your posture**. Those two things alone will make your guitar seem a lot lighter. I play with a B.C. Rich Ironbird, and her neck is quite heavy compared to her body. A quick strap adjustment and a little work on my then-terrible and still not that great posture makes her feel lighter when I play.

I think the idea of trying to complete games for percentage completion is misguided. Sure, it might be satisfying to see a 100% completion rate, but it doesn't really measure your skill in playing the game. It's more of a measure of luck and guessing. I'd much rather try to complete a game as quickly as possible, or set some other challenge to measure my skill. For example, if I want to measure my skill in Minesweeper, I might set a goal of completing it in under 100 seconds. That way, I'm testing my skill in the game, rather than just relying on luck.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/gaming with title ""You're math isn't necessarily wrong, you're just looking at it the wrong way...if you want to play a game like minesweeper (that usually requires guessing/chance to complete) for completion percentages go right ahead...I just don't see the point in playing that way...if I'm going for accuracy/completion then I set something like ""I want to see how many I can complete ""in under 100 seconds"" since a percentage of games completed isn't a proper attribute of skill.""","The only way you're going to have a chance at being correct in this is if time have no bearing on this...starting from the corner gives you a more consistent, but far inferior on average, start.

Starting from the corner gives you 5/8 of the squares bomb-free, but only 1/4 of the area to expand into...so stupid to make the arguement that 62.5% less bombs is worth a drop in 75% expansion.

Further proof still (they also make the arguement that corner is SAFER, but NOT BETTER):


...if that's not convincing enough, go watch any ""pro"" or fast minesweeper video and I can guarantee they start around the middle. They're going to be hovering the F2 key to restart a new game and just spam middle clicks and F2 until they get a good start...while I was more of a casual player and never used this ""try hard"" method, it is by far the most efficient way to drop times in your games after switching to double-click (though, double-click is really only helpful in expert and sometimes in intermediate)

Hey everyone, 

I've been playing a lot of video games lately, and I've noticed that a lot of people don't know how to get better at the game. I've been trying to help people out by giving advice and tips on how to improve their gameplay, and one thing I've noticed is that the middle is still the best place to be in most games. 

I know some people don't like hearing that and it can come off as a bit abrasive, and I'm sorry if I've come off that way. It's just that when I try to explain something to people, I like to provide sources and examples to back up my points. That's why my posts tend to be a bit long. 

If you're interested in taking your gaming to the next level, I'd highly recommend checking out [insert website here]. It's a great resource for learning more about the serious side of gaming.

...I'm not sure that giving you a free square when the chances are already low matters enough to make an impact:
  30x16 array makes 480 squares and 99 bombs gives you a 79.375% chance of hitting an empty square on the first click...making that 100% isn't really making much of a difference

Now, that becomes even less important when you consider that someone going for a record/fast time isn't going to continue until they hit a large expanse...something that very rarely happens on the first try and usually takes numerous clicks...say 3 clicks and the total percentage is (forgive me for not making lazy stats) 35% vs 49% which is only 14% difference -- meaning you'd have to spend roughly 1/8th more time before getting a good start at 3 clicks and that figure is only going to dwindle as the number of clicks are increased.

  when I would go for a personal best time, I wouldn't start playing unless I had an expanse of roughly 1/5 of the board showing--whether that be one huge expanse or multiple small ones

Further more, the ""free click"" versions of Minesweeper (post-XP) aren't even legal for competition and official scores.

...not trying to be pretentious in this last bit (or any of my posts...full intent is to make other people better players) but a serious player just isn't going to use the windows version at all...there is a special ""official"" version. I remember that it kept track of stats that shown the amount of skill for any given game (taking into consideration the empty spaces and the amount of work needed to pass the level) and it might have even have a feature which records games for playback.

It's funny how sometimes our natural instincts don't always work in our favor. Take the game of tic-tac-toe for example. We tend to think that the best first move is to take the corner spot, but it's actually one of the worst moves you can make. Taking the corner spot gives your opponent the opportunity to take the center spot and gain a huge advantage. So next time you play tic-tac-toe, remember that corner is the worst possible first move...sometimes natural instincts aren't helpful at all.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/gaming with title ""Corner is the worst possible first move...sometimes natural instincts aren't helpful at all.""","There are equal chances that a corner will contain a bomb as any other square...yet clicking he corner only provides insight on up to 3 neighboring squares compared to 8 if starting from the middle. After that first click you have only 3 moves to follow up with...if any if those has a bomb you have no ""free"" moves...if going from he middle you have options under the same circumstances.

This post is about how some people on Reddit have been posting about their suicidal thoughts or feelings, and then at the end of the post adding something like ""just kidding"" or ""just trolling"" as if it were a joke.

Making jokes about suicide is not only insensitive and hurtful, but it can also be triggering for those who are struggling with suicidal thoughts. It can make them feel like they're not being taken seriously or that their feelings are not valid.

If you're looking to get into Shadowrun, I highly recommend checking out the free Quickstart guide before you spend any money. It'll give you a great idea of whether or not the game system is right for you. If you decide to go ahead and invest in the 20th Anniversary edition, you should also plan on getting at least 10d6 per player plus an additional 10-20d6. After that, I recommend picking up the Augmentation, Street Magic, Unwired, and Companion supplements in that order, depending on what you feel you need. The Sixth World Almanac is an awesome resource, and I suggest reading it even if you don't end up liking the game system.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Shadowrun with title ""Check the free Quickstart before you spend money.

Sixth World Almanac is an awesome resource and I recommend reading it even if you don't like the game system.""","You'll eventually want to get all these books, but I put them in order you'll probably want to buy them. You can download the Quickstart for free off the CGL Shadowrun website to see if the game's for you before you plop down money for the books.

Shadowrun 20th Anniversary Edition - Current edition of the core rulebook. You can't play the game without this.

Augmentation - Additional cyberware, bioware, nanoware, and other forms of augmentation. This is probably going to be your first splatbook because every single new player of the game *loves* playing a street sam. You're a badass right out of the gate, as opposed to magicians and adepts who require a lot of build-up to reach their full potential of badassery. The downside is that you're not going to improve all that much after you start.

Street Magic: This is the magic sourcebook. You actually need this more than you need Augmentation, but Augmentation is more fun.

Unwired: This is the most important but least useful of the ""core"" splatbooks. I know that sounds like a contradiction, but you really need this book to run Matrix stuff. However, no one ever seems to want to be a hacker when they can be a badass cyberninja or Harry Dresden.

Shadowrun Companion: This has a crapload of optional rules that will flesh out a lot of stuff for you. I'd suggest getting this one after you've gotten your head around the other books and you're needing something to liven up your game.

Sixth World Almanac: This is a *must* book in my opinion as it's a complete breakdown of the Shadowrun timeline and where it diverges from our own (since the game was written in 1989 originally). Lots of good material for adventure seeds and it's just a fun read. The second half of the book isn't as interesting since it's a very basic primer on all the major countries/regions of the world. Read over these, then go find used copies or PDF reprints of the previous edition versions of these books as they tend to have a *lot* more information about the countries/cities.

Canon Companion: Guns and armor. This is a book you're really going to want to buy, but one you really don't need to buy it honestly.

Okay, here's the most important thing. You need a metric assload of six-sided dice. I think the kind with pips (dots) work better in Shadowrun than the kind with numerals on them. I also highly recommend buying a bulk order of them off Amazon, then taking some paint to them. My Shadowrun dice are black dice with white pips, and I used black paint to black out the numbers 2, 3, and 4; then added red paint to the number 1. This really helps in 4th Edition Shadowrun since all you care about on the dice are which ones are 5s and 6s and which ones are 1s. That coloring really makes them pop on the table and speeds up gameplay threefold, especially in combat.

Now, the single most important tool - even more important than any book beyond the core rulebook - is the character generation/management software you use. If you have a license for Lone Wolf's HeroLab, pick up the Shadowrun kit for it if you want to pay for it. If you don't, get a free program called Chummer. THIS is why I say Canon Companion is a waste of money when you're starting out. Both HeroLab and Chummer have all the stats for the weapons in Canon Companion, and that's the single most important part of the book. Sure, there's optional advanced combat rules, but they tend to slow things down too much. And there's the gun customization rules, but they tend to lead massively toward munchkining.

**TL;DR** Check the free Quickstart before you spend money. If Shadowrun's for you, you want the 20th Anniversary edition and at least 10d6 per player plus an additional 10-20d6. After that, pick up Augmentation, Street Magic, Unwired, and Companion in that order as you feel you need them. Sixth World Almanac is an awesome resource and I recommend reading it even if you don't like the game system."

Vehicles used to be crutches for low-skill players in the Halo franchise, but recent tweaks have made them much more difficult to use effectively, forcing vehicle operators to use skill and planning in order to be successful. The introduction of the ""vehicle health"" system has made it so that vehicles can no longer take an endless amount of punishment, and the introduction of the ""vehicle boost"" system has made it so that vehicles no longer move at lightning speed. These changes have increased the skill gap between players who know how to use vehicles effectively and those who don't, and have made vehicles more of a strategic asset than a crutch.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/halo with title ""Vehicles used to be crutches for low-skill players. The tweaks made force vehicle operators to do so with skill and planning.""","Vehicles should NOT be changed; let me tell you why. 

Vehicles already have higher threshholds from my experience. In Reach, a plasma to a ghost would blow it up every single time, even if the guy got into a brand spankin' new ghost. This isn't the case any more. If anything, I think the damage threshholds might need to be lowered. I thought that H3 -&gt; Reach's transition where small arms fire can now meaningfully damage vehicles was a positive one and I'm glad 343 continued the trend. 

Some friends and I went back and played some H3 and, to nobody's surprise, we played BTB Valhalla. Shooting the banshee with a BR felt like I was shooting it angry glances instead of bullets. The cunt wound up going something like +20. Those games aren't fun. Games where someone in a vehicle dominates is fun for ONE person: the person in the vehicle.

 With damage threshholds the way they are, it forces the person operating the vehicle to do so with skill, instead of the vehicle providing ""insta-skill"" where before it was lacking. Basically, it's still possible to scrap together some good sprees in vehicles; you've just got to go about it in a smart way. Don't rush out in the mantis. Take cover and let those vehicle shields recharge. And if you know the tank gets destroyed nearly instantaneously, then for fuck's sake don't get in it!

I recently had a discussion with a friend about the risk of damage to an unstrung guitar. My friend was of the opinion that an unstrung guitar was more vulnerable to damage than an unmounted guitar neck. I argued that the risk of damage is the same for both, since the neck is the most vulnerable part of the guitar and is equally exposed in both cases.

After some back and forth, we decided to ask around to see if anyone else had any opinions on the matter. So, what do you think - is an unstrung guitar at more risk for damage than an unmounted guitar neck?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Guitar with title ""An unstrung guitar is at no more risk for damage than an unmounted guitar neck.""","The purpose of the truss rod is to stabilize the relief (curvature) of the neck. Because wood is not a fully rigid object, it is to a minor extend malleable as it is a porous material that is also affected by external factors such as humidity and temperature change; those factors cause the wood to lose its shape and flex and bend. The truss rod is there to allow you to correct any of these minor changes in the relief of the neck. 

String of different gauge size will also have different tension on the neck wood, this is another external factor that can cause flex in the neck - and another reason the truss rod exists to allow you to counteract this tension. However, in the context of your post, removing the strings from a guitar for a short term period of time (time period it takes to ship) should not have any lasting negative affect on the neck, at worst, the neck will back bow slightly due to the countertension of the truss rod, but no fretboard tension due to the lack of strings. But once you restring your guitar and give it some time to settle back and equalize the back bow will correct itself and everything will be back to normal. 

**TL;DR:** An unstrung guitar is at no more risk for damage than an unmounted guitar neck."

Hey ladies, 

I'm curious what you think about the idea that guys should just pay the bill without her noticing on the first few dates. If she doesn't return the favor after 3 dates, then it's time to move on.

I much prefer when the guy smoothly has his credit card/cash out and just hands it to the server.  So then there is no awkward moment when we're both staring at the check.  Then I will proceed to thank him for dinner and offer to buy drinks after dinner.  This also leads to extended date time :). 

After the 3rd or 4th date is when I will start alternating paying for dinners, tickets etc..  And for the guys, if she does not start buying a few drinks, dinners etc by the 3rd or 4th date, she is probably high maintenance and you should run far far away.

When it comes to dating, I believe in the old-fashioned approach of letting the guy pay. It's a sign of respect and appreciation, and it shows him that you value him and the time you spend together. I know it can feel awkward to let him pay, especially if you make a decent salary yourself, but it's a nice gesture that will make him feel appreciated.

I think it's a nice gesture, since not offering to pay any of it seems as if you expected him to pay the bill in the first place. Normally, if he has manners he would insist at least once on paying it after your suggestion. Then let him. 

If you enjoyed your time together you could add something like ""Ok, I'll pick it up the next time ;)"" which gives him a positive feedback and steers him towards not having any doubts about ""should I ask her out again?"". Furthermore it gives you feedback as well. If he enjoyed it as well he won't be able to not smile on that comment.
The worst that could happen: There won't be a second date but the first one didn't cost you anything but your time.
Last but not least a scenario like that would at least take a little weight off of that awkward moment at the end, since it just became more clear for both of you that you (both) had a great time!

My younger cousins parents were going through a nasty divorce.  He was living with us that summer while his parents got their shit together.  I took him out with me whenever I went to hang with friends or party.

Near the end of summer my cousin said this ""John, no offense but; you are not the best looking guy in the world.  How do you always have these hot girls all over you?""

The answer is amazingly simple.  Be confident, be funny and be nice.  Even ugly guys like be can get hot girls if you are not afraid to talk to them.  Treat them like people, not objects and generally just try to have fun.  I think the having fun part is most important.  Don't try to pick up girls, just wherever you are have a good time, bring your own party.  Don't be afraid to look dumb.  Look dumb every chance you get.  Tell terrible jokes, laugh at yourself, laugh with others.

Maybe I have an advantage because overall I'm a VERY positive person.  When someone asks me ""How are you today?""  The answer is always ""AWESOME!  How are you?""

If you're looking for undergarments, I would highly recommend going for the waffle textured ones. The prices are usually the same as regular ones, but the waffle texture provides a lot more comfort and breathability. I've been wearing them for a few weeks now and I'm really happy with the results. The waffle texture also does a great job of wicking away sweat, so you'll stay dry and comfortable all day.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/malefashionadvice with title ""since the prices are the same, I would highly recommend going for the waffle textured undergarments.""","I'm a southern Californian who moved to NYC last year so I've had to pick up a bunch of winter clothes all at once. I wondered if a combination of the Heattech long-sleeved undershirt plus long johns would might allow me to avoid wearing the super chunky overcoats that these Northeasterners all seem to own, so I set to trying it out. Now, I've noticed that the Heattech undergarments are not all created equal. The long-sleeved undershirts come in three different textures: [normal]( [ribbed]( and [waffle]( The long johns come in [normal]( and [waffle]( The difference is quite subtle in these online photos, but very noticeable in real life. Even the material is different, as you can see on the web pages. More importantly, the waffle items are noticeably thicker than the normal and ribbed ones. 

As an experiment, I bought one of each type and tried wearing them out in cold weather. I felt that the normal and ribbed undershirts did warm me slightly, but really did not make me any warmer than a thick cotton undershirt would (for less than half the price). The normal long johns were nice of course, but still only a minor help. Wearing the waffle undergarments, however, really did make a noticeable difference for me. I was able to walk around outside in a blazer, sweater, and jeans at times when everyone else was wearing their heavy coats. And this is coming from a soft-skinned Californian who has seen snow maybe a dozen times in his entire life. Of course there were still days when I had to wear a coat and all that, but Heattech underwear definitely allowed me to reduce the bulk.

TL;DR since the prices are the same, I would highly recommend going for the waffle textured undergarments. "

When it comes to physical attractiveness, it's not the only thing that matters. Girls put a lot of emphasis on personality too. As we get to know someone better, our perception of their looks can change. Depending on what stage of life you're in, girls may be looking for different things. For example, when you're young, physical looks may be more important, but as you get older, personality and compatibility become more important. Ultimately, it's important to remember that physical attractiveness is not the only thing that matters, and that it's important to focus on developing a strong personality and finding someone who is compatible with you.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskMen with title ""Physical attractiveness is not all that matters, girls put a LOT of emphasis on personality. The more we get to know someone the better or worse looking they get to us. Also depending on what stage of your life you are in, girls look for different things.""","Girl here and I would like add my two cents. Here is what I try to tell my brother but he doesn't ever listen, maybe you will. For girls, attractiveness isn't a completely physical thing, maybe initially, you might catch our eye, but overall it is not the most important thing. Once you get to know someone, the way you see them changes. They get more or less attractive depending on their personality. If you are a generally good guy, your attractiveness goes up once we get to know you but if you are a huge douche all the time, even if you look like a Greek god, no girl worth keeping is going to stick around. Also attractiveness is very subjective, me, I personally would want someone who makes me happy and that I feel comfortable with rather than someone who looks good with me because eventually we will both get old and his looks will be gone. 

I don't know how old you are but also what women want changes over the years. In high school, a lot of really good guys get overlooked unfortunately because those girls don't know yet to pick substance. They learn eventually but sometimes it takes a while. In college the girls are pretty much split to the ones who still think like high school girls and they just want to have a good time so they pick the physically attractive guys. There are the girls who are looking for someone to have a relationship with, they look for long term features. Lastly there are the girls who just want to keep their heads down and focus on their studies because a bachelors degree is not their final goal. These girls don't really look at anything other than their text books and if you can pry their eyes away, they are also going to want personality. 

TL;DR Physical attractiveness is not all that matters, girls put a LOT of emphasis on personality. The more we get to know someone the better or worse looking they get to us. Also depending on what stage of your life you are in, girls look for different things. "

Hey everyone,

I'm sure many of us have heard the phrase ""looks don't matter as much as confidence"" before, but what does it really mean? How can you tell if someone is truly confident or just putting on a show?

I think confidence is something that comes from within. It's a combination of self-esteem, self-belief, and self-assurance. It's not just about how you look or what you wear, but rather how you carry yourself and interact with others.

Confidence can be a tricky thing to measure, but it's something that can make a huge difference in how you are perceived. It's also something that can be cultivated over time.

So, if you're looking to improve your confidence, start by believing in yourself and your abilities. Surround yourself with people who are supportive and positive. Take time to focus on your strengths and weaknesses and work on improving them. And, last but not least, practice positive self-talk and be kind to yourself.

Thanks for reading!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskMen with title ""Looks don't matter as much as confidence.""","If you believe you are attractive, you will be attractive. Physical attractiveness is not nearly as important as confidence and knowing you're a boss and any lady would be lucky to have you. That shit drives women nuts.

Make her laugh and it's game over.

Hey everyone, 
I recently had a conversation about how it doesn't seem right to put one sex regarding looks as less important than the other as both sexes feature a wide range of personalities and approaches to dating. I acknowledged that it was somewhat less than that with women. I said that it was not that much less than attractive women with fat men. I honestly haven't seen either that often, so in my experience one isn't greater than the other. I added slightly less than women purely from gained experience from the internet, which increased both. I should have clarified. 

Here's the big thing, men are often the ones asking other's out. So, comparing women asking out fat men, and men asking out fat women (both attractive), in both cases they are relatively rare. However, if you add in accepting a date. In this regard, both cases rise up. In my experience, mature men and women, will both accept someone who they like personality wise, but who is on the pudgy side of things. It is hard to compare the two because current social standards have men asking out women, more often than women asking out men. I have seen very few women actually ask out the nice fat guy, but who would accept. Same with men, they wouldn't ask, but would accept. However, in both cases there are some who will ask out the fatter party. 

Sorry for the jumble, I am tired. I'm curious to hear what other people's experiences are when it comes to this topic.

However, if one adds prolonged contact to both, than it muddles up and is less clear. but in my life so far through personal( more weighted to what I previously mentioned) and through threads like these one really can't generalize how one sex acts towards the other.

Women are apt to view looks secondary, though in my experience not more so. I have experienced this through observation, not participation maybe that effects it.

Secondly, men seem to always be characterised for putting looks secondary to other things. However, I find this only works under the hivemind. A man with friends might focus on looks( or will stay quiet), whereas a man having  a man to man chat will not focus on looks so much, and once a certain depth of conversation is reached, puts a lot more importance on personality for a relationship

Also, I have, not often but I have, hung out and listened to groups of women. I find that they often betray that which you present as fact. I found that in a group, just like men, they are, in my personal experience,  extremely looks oriented. They criticize men I know, celebrities, random people across the street for being unattractive or praise them for being attractive. I mention men I know because that accounts for them roughly knowing that guy's personality. So, in the aspect of groups, I have found men and women act similarly. Now, individually, like men, they are a lot more lenient on looks, however, I would not say more so than a man of the same maturity level.

TL:DR. It doesn't seem right to put one sex regarding looks as less important than the other as both sexes feature a wide range of personalities and approaches to dating.

Hey everyone, 

I recently bought a Ford Focus ST, and I regret it. It's not as fun as I thought it would be, and it's not great in the snow. Instead, I recommend the Mazda3 hatchback. It's a blast to drive, and it's a lot cheaper in the long run. Plus, it works great in the snow. So if you're in the market for a new car, stay away from the ST and go for the Mazda3--but not the Speed version. 

Hope this helps!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/cars with title ""Stay away from the ST, it's not as cool as you think.  Go for a Mazda3--not the Speed--hatchback. Works fine in the snow, is a blast to drive, and is cheap in the long run.""","Fresh out of school, eh?  Let's get serious for a second.  Does the car you have right now work?  Do you really need a car payment?  Are you sure that your job won't lose a contract and you'll be dropped in the first 3 months?

I ask this because I've had several friends go through this.  ""I got a job! Look at my new car!"" 76 days later...""Well, they lost the bid they hired me for, so, I'm looking for a new job...and I didn't work with them long enough to get unemployment.""

A $20-30k NEW car is a lot for someone getting their first out-of-school job, though I'm assuming you're not a lawyer or working a management role in some oil field I don't know about in Iowa.

Seriously, car payments suck.  I make good money and my $400/mo payment bums me out.  I waited a year after I got my job, was like ""Yeah, I can pull this off,"" but, no, that's a huge chunk of change just gone.  My insurance and gas receipts went up, too, because I went from a get-me-through-school Toyota Echo to a Mazda3.  What's your credit like?  If it's good, you may be okay, but if it's under 700 like fresh-out-of-college kids who've only had a credit card in their name for a couple of years, you may be hurting yourself.

Anyway, that's a lot of what ifs.  You may be in good standing, have the money to spare, may have a beater of a car or no car at all; it may be good for you to get a car right off the bat. However, if you can survive with the car you have now, I would **highly recommend** dumping what you think you would run on a car payment into a Roth IRA or your 401(k) for the first year.  Then, as you get a raise, that money stays funneling in there and you can be more settled into your monthly routine and know how much you can spare on a car.  That's the other thing: you think you know what your budget will be like, but until you get to the job and even out your social life, figure out if the place you rent sucks for gas bills, etc, you don't really know if you'll have to cut out stuff to have the car.  For some people the answer may be ""the car is most important,"" so, if that's you, go ahead.

tl;dr : Stay away from the ST, it's not as cool as you think.  Go for a Mazda3--not the Speed--hatchback. Works fine in the snow, is a blast to drive, and is cheap in the long run."

One summer, I had taken to running evenings because my schedule wouldn't allow me to be up before it got blistering hot.  This became a problem one fateful Friday night.

I get home after a few beers with friends at a sports bar.  I'm feeling a little buzzed, but I'll be damned if I miss my evening run.  I strap on my shoes and head out the door.  Somewhere around mile two it occurs to me that I had underestimated my level of drunkenness.  Fuck it, I'm already out here anyway, right?  

Not long after that, a beat up pickup truck passes me, and I see a redneck scream lean out the passenger window and yell ""Put some damn clothes on, man!""  (I was shirtless.)  It's worth noting that I live in Kentucky, so just imagine your best redneck stereotype, and you can picture the situation.  With my normally razor-sharp wit dulled by alcohol, the best thing I could retort was ""**FUUUUCK YOUUUU!!!**"" and the double middle-finger salute.  I found great humor, and giggled for at least a minute afterwards.

Then, inspiration struck.  Suddenly, every person who had ever yelled something smartass at me while I was running came to me in an instant.  In that instant, empowered by the alcohol and the hilarity, I realized that **I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS SHIT ANYMORE**

I decided that every single car I saw was going to get the same treatment as the redneck in that beat up 80's pickup.  It was time for the revenge run.  I spent the next few miles screaming obscenities and making rude gestures to cars, while giggling like a little girl.

To put a little perspective on the situation, it is 1 in the morning on a Saturday, I am screaming at traffic while running down the street giggling and shirtless.

I'm starting to wind down and sober up, and I'm about a mile from my house.  A member of the local PD drives past, pulls a U-turn and stops to have a chat with me, because apparently they had received a few calls about a runner wearing black shorts screaming at cars.

The rest of my run was serious business after that.

The Detroit Lions had a tough decision to make on Sunday night against the Green Bay Packers. With the game tied and just over a minute left in the 4th quarter, the Lions were faced with a 4th and goal from the Packers' 2-yard line. The Lions decided to take the safe route and kick a field goal to take the lead, rather than risk a turnover by throwing the ball.

While some may argue that the Lions should have gone for it on 4th down, I think they made the right decision. The Packers' defense had been playing well all game and the Lions were likely to turn the ball over if they had thrown the ball. Taking the field goal was the second best option and it gave them the lead with only a minute left.

The Lions may have taken the safe route, but they still made the right decision. They didn't throw the ball and risk a turnover, and they still took the lead. It was a tough decision, but the Lions made the right call.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/detroitlions with title ""They did take the second best option. They didn't throw it. They shouldn't have thrown it unless they are going for it on 4th down.""","I didn't like the call, but there is no way they would have done what we SHOULD have done.

You have 2 options. 1.) go for the win. 2.) play for your defense.

They chose option 2, and they played it right for that option. 40 seconds in a 2 minute drill really IS a shit ton of time. Thats about 4 plays with spikes, or 2 in a hurry up. That is a huge difference.

However, I am a fan of option 1. Go for the win. To do this, however, this would have been 4 down territory. That gives you 2 plays to get 5 yards. If you miss it once, go for it again. No fake punt, no shenanigans, just 2 tries to get the first down. Even with the punt if you don't down it, you only lose about 30 yards, which I believe they recovered in what, 3 plays? GO FOR IT! WIN THE GAME! A first down seals it.

TL;DR They did take the second best option. They didn't throw it. They shouldn't have thrown it unless they are going for it on 4th down."

Hey everyone,

I recently bought a 4-door Cherokee XJ and I'm looking to get a 2-door gasser. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on what I should do with my current XJ. Should I just sell it as is or salvage what I can from it? I'm thinking of taking the windows, t-case (if it is an HD model), axles, etc. and using them on the new 2-door.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/CherokeeXJ with title ""Get a 2-door gasser and salvage what you can from your current one.  Windows, t-case if it is an HD model, axles, etc.""","Personally I would go with the 4.0.  Given that motor was still being used over here till 2006 there are a lot more aftermarket parts for them and a lot more OEM parts to rebuild the motors.  That said, I don't know what kind of parts support you have in France for the 4.0 verses the diesel.

As for 2-door vs. 4 door, that will come down to personal preference.  I had a four-door and it was great because I could access the back seat area for storage.  Now I have a ZJ and I use the back seat almost exclusively for my dog.  However, I always liked the looks of the 2-door XJ and if I didn't need/want a back seat I would just remove it and do a rear cargo drawer setup and just access it from the hatch.

In terms of parts you could salvage from your diesel, your axles, wheels/tires, exterior and interior parts should all carry over.  The only thing that would be different would be the engine and transmission. May even use the same (or maybe a stronger) transfer case.  If it does have the stronger 231HD transfer-case with the 6-gear planetary set up **keep it.**

**TL;DR:** Get a 2-door gasser and salvage what you can from your current one.  Windows, t-case if it is an HD model, axles, etc."

I've been working in retail for almost two years now and I can tell you that it's not an easy job. You're constantly dealing with customers who are angry, stressed, and just plain rude. On top of that, you're expected to be cheerful, helpful, and accommodating. It can be difficult to stay positive in such an environment.

That's why I always tell people who are considering a job in retail to take their sanity into their own hands. If you're not enjoying your job, don't be afraid to quit. But if you're determined to stay, then make it fun. Find ways to make the job more enjoyable by talking to your coworkers, playing games with customers, or even just taking a break to do something you enjoy.

No matter what you decide, remember that it's your job and you have the power to make it a positive experience. So take your sanity into your own hands and make the most of your retail job.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/TalesFromRetail with title ""Take your sanity into your own hands.  Quit, or make your job fun.""","I worked retail for about 3 years while I applied for jobs in my field.  The main (and probably the only) reason I survived was that I had fun with it.  I, too, was a supervisor and had to deal with all sorts of ridiculous customers but I'd make the most of the ones that were nice.  I'd go out of my way to help them and they'd appreciate it.  At the end of the day I'd have fun while cleaning up and closing the store.  I got in trouble once for singing ""White Christmas"" over the PA after inhaling some helium while my manager chased me to take the Spectralink phone away from me.

There are a few ways to look at this.  If you're good enough at your job and the managers appreciate you enough then you'll be able to get away with making your job fun (this has the added bonus of making those in your charge a little more relaxed as well).  If you're not appreciated enough to get some leeway or you're not good enough at your job then you should leave.  This may sound insensitive but it's for your own mental health and for the good of the company as well.  An unstable or unhappy employee does nothing for morale except tank it and it certainly doesn't improve the public's view of the company.

A final piece of advice, hit the assholes where it hurts - in the wallet.  I would give people discounts based on how (un)pleasant they were.  If you were buying a clearance item and you were a dick you'd pay whatever price I put on there.  If you were nice then I just happened to be discounting this right now!  How convenient!  If you were an asshole returning something past our 90 day return policy I'll offer you the lowest refund possible (the price of any sale during that period), but if you treated me like a person I'd turn the key and give you full a price refund.  Customers often left coupon books at the store.  If you were nice I'd give you either the coupon you need to make that $300 item come down into your price range or I'd give you the whole book.

**TL;DR:** Take your sanity into your own hands.  Quit, or make your job fun."

I recently had a customer come in to my store who was trying to return an item he had purchased a few days prior. I told him that since he had already used the item he could not return it, but he became very angry and started to yell at me. I calmly explained that I was just following company policy and that I was sorry for any inconvenience. 

At this point, I had two choices. I could either try to appease the customer and offer a discount or I could stand firm and not give in to his demands. I chose the latter option because I knew that if I gave him a discount, other customers would expect the same. 

My policy is to save the good customers as much money as possible, while still staying within the bounds of the law. But for the customers who are unreasonable and try to take advantage of the system, I will not give in to their demands. 

It's important to remember that as a retail worker, you have to be able to stand your ground and not let customers take advantage of you.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/TalesFromRetail with title ""save the good customers as much money as possible, screw the shitty customers out of as much as possible while still staying within the bounds of the law.""","Oh, doing the last bit of what you suggested is so empowering and it really does make retail fun at times.

You get a dickhead that's buying something that has an instant coupon they need to bring into the store?  Why no, I'm not going to just automatically apply that to your order, you'll be paying full price.  Regular stock item that also comes in a gift set?  Not only will I not be telling you about the gift set, but if I know you won't ask for a receipt I'll put in the gift set code, put the regular item back on the shelf, and save the gifts for a more deserving customer.

Promotional stuff gets saved only for the good regulars that treat us with respect.

Definitely with you on the return policy as well - could also enforce the ""you have to leave it here and the upper level manager, who only visits once monthly, has to approve the return and THEN you will receive your refund"" policy.

I'm not sure exactly what to believe in terms of karma, as far as a person getting things coming around to them based on how they treat others throughout life, but I know that it sure feels nice to help karma along a little.

As college football fans, we all know that the current system of deciding a national champion is far from ideal. It leaves us with a system that is often criticized for being unfair and not truly determining the best team in the country. 

What if there was an alternative? What if we could have a 16 team NCAA tournament and 8 team NIT tournament that included conference champions? This would give us a much better idea of who the best team in the country is, and it would be a much more exciting way to decide the national champion. 

I know this will never happen in college football, but I think it would be the best way to decide the national champion. It would be a much fairer system, and it would give us a much better idea of who the best team in the country is. 

What do you think? Do you think this is the best way to decide the national champion, or do you think the current system is better? Let me know your thoughts in the comments!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/CFB with title ""16 team NCAA Tournament and 8 team NIT tournaments including conference champions.  But please read this before commenting that this will never happen, because I completely realize that this will never happen in college football, I just think that this would be the best way to decide the national champion.""","This is what I would love to be the post-season in college football.  The bowl games are still below these 2 tournaments and the losers in the first 2 rounds drop down into bowl games.  These 2 tournaments are the national championship tournament (Tournament of Roses, ToR) and a kind of NIT with the next best teams (Orange Bowl Invitational Tournament, OBIT).  There are just a few simple selection rules that I followed to come up with this field.

1.Every conference champion of a conference with at least 8 teams gets to participate in the ToR.  The left over slots are decided by the BCS rankings.  The OBIT field is determined by the highest 8 teams in the BCS that did not get into the ToR.

2.Teams from the same conference cannot play each other in the first 2 rounds (this affectively limits a conference’s participation to 4 teams in the ToR and 2 additional teams in the OBIT).

3.If a team participates in their conference’s championship game and lose, they cannot move behind a team from their own division that is ranked behind the participating team leading into the conference championship game (This year, Georgia cannot move behind Florida because Georgia was ranked higher than Florida heading into the SECCG).

Format: The first 2 rounds of both tournaments are single elimination and are hosted by the higher seed.  The winners of the 2 bracket pools of the OBIT advance to the Orange Bowl.  The 4 winners of the bracket pools of the ToR are re-seeded (highest seed left plays lowest seed left, 2nd highest seed left plays 2nd lowest seed left) regardless of conference.  The highest seed left in the tournament then chooses which semi-final bowl game their semi-final will be (Fiesta Bowl or Sugar Bowl).  The winners of the Fiesta Bowl and Sugar Bowl advance to the Rose Bowl National Championship Game.

Other: This post season structure would not work with our current model of a 13th conference championship game so in order for this to happen divisional conferences would need to have a sort of cross over last week so that all the teams are playing the week before the tournament would start.  Also, all teams would have to play 12 games in the first 13 weeks, then week 14 and 15 would be the 1st and 2nd round of the tournament.  There would then be a final exams break and then the semifinal/other bowls/Orange Bowl would happen followed by at least a week break and then the Rose Bowl Final.  Before people say that 16 games is too many, I would just like to point out that under the current system USC is going to play 13 regular season games next year (due to going to Hawaii) and if they make the Pac12CG and a bowl they will play in 15 games.  Then, starting in 2014 if a team goes to Hawaii they could play 16 games if they play 13 regular season, their conf. championship, the semi-final, and the Final.
 
TLDR; 16 team NCAA Tournament and 8 team NIT tournaments including conference champions.  But please read this before commenting that this will never happen, because I completely realize that this will never happen in college football, I just think that this would be the best way to decide the national champion."

It's so frustrating that the gaming industry is so out of touch with their consumers. With the ridiculous prices they charge for games, and the lack of customer service, it's no wonder that piracy is becoming more and more attractive. It's the only option until the industry reforms and takes into account what their customers actually want.

 edit - Welcome to circlebroke, where if you have a dissenting opinion, we just downvote you until you go away.  Time for me to unsub I guess.""","This is two extremes that I don't think anyone can agree with.

DRM used to be very simple (and for many companies still is).  A unique game code.  Allow only one game code to come online at a time and you shut down piracy like what this company experienced.

The current problem with gaming is multi-faceted, but excessive DRM kills games.  

As someone who pirates games (and buys them later if I like them) I find there is a sickening lack of ways to preview a game.  Many ""demos"" are too short or limited to get an experience of the game or aren't actual game play. A game I might have never bought on my own is Tropico 4.  I like city builders but it didn't sound very good but I thought I would try it.  Loved it.  Bought it.  Bought all the DLC.

On the flip side there are a number of games where I thought the premise sounded great but ended up being just awful like Sins of a Solar Empire, for example.  I would have been very upset if I paid $50 for the game.  It's just awful.

A lot of my grief comes from being younger and buying games at premium prices only to get home and be incredibly disappointed by the quality and/or game play. 

If the industry wanted to reduce piracy (not eliminate because it will never happen), there are a few simple things to actually combat the problem:

* Remove intrusive DRM - Always Online DRM, Account Login, Internet required activation, CD required etc and go back to a simple system.

* Reduce the cost if you aren't buying on physical media, reduce the cost of the game

* Make the price of the game based off time played, not a set media price.  Why am I paying $60 for a game that has 50 hours of game time versus the same cost for a game with 10 hours of game time?

* Standardize the cost and release dates of game across borders.  There is no reason Australia should pay double the cost for a game AND have to wait 2 months extra to get it.

* Value loyalty among customers.  If I am buying Assassins Creed 52, and I have purchased the previous versions, throw me a bone.  This doesn't even have to be a monetary incentive - give me a bonus level, weapon or something.

* Revert DLC to expansions.  Instead of $3 here and $2 there, release a big pack for $10 as an expansion.  This is what stayed my hand from buying Tropico 4 at first.  $30 for the game and another $30 for DLC was too much for the game.

* Make DRM like Batman Arkham Asylum.  For those that don't know, anyone trying to circumvent the DLC was stopped just a few levels in by an intentionally placed ""bug"".

* Lastly, allow Steam and other resellers to set prices on their own.  Stop trying to horde profits.  Steam has led the way for sales and packages to make tons of money for companies.  I would even argue that Steam saved a dying gaming industry with its Steam Sales.  

I won't argue that Piracy isn't stealing.  It is.  However, without any other option, we are left in this predicament.  I would have saved thousands of dollars in purchases the last few years without Piracy because I absolutely can't stand to purchase a game and hate it.  I can't return it after opening it, there wasn't any way to play it before hand because games for PC aren't rented at blockbuster like XBox games are...I'm stuck.  Piracy returned that ability to me.  It also allows me to purchase when I feel the price is right for the game.  I liked Dragon Age, and bought it when it hit $30 which I believed was a fair price instead of the $100 (with all the DLC).

tl;dr Piracy is the only option until the gaming industry reforms.

Overclocking is a complex and difficult process that requires a lot of knowledge and skill. There is no ""set way"" to get overclocking down to a science due to variances in silicon, parts, temperatures, etc, etc, etc. That being said, there are some general principles that one should follow to get the most out of their overclocking experience. 

First and foremost, it is important to keep temperatures in check. Overclocking can result in higher temperatures that can cause instability or even permanent damage to components. Using high quality cooling solutions can go a long way in keeping temperatures under control. 

Second, it is important to know the limits of your components. Overclocking can push components to their limits and beyond, so it is important to know what your components are capable of and to push them only as far as they can go. 

Finally, it is important to experiment and find out what works best for you and your hardware. Different components and systems will respond differently to overclocking, so it is important to find out what works best for you. 

Overall, overclocking can be a rewarding experience if done properly. There is no ""set way"" to get overclocking down to a science, but following the general principles outlined above can go a long way in helping you get the most out of your overclocking experience.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/overclocking with title ""There is no ""set way"" to get overclocking down to a science due to variances in silicon, parts, temperatures, etc, etc, etc.""","Trial and Error. Lots of testing. Generally it could go something like this (10 minutes in Mspaint for me):

Keep in mind, this chart assume your voltages are within safe limits, temperatures are in check, and everything in your computer is working as intended. Faulty hardware, high temperatures or other random glitches can throw a wrench into any overclocking session.



Say for example, you want 4.5 GHz. You set your CPU to 4.5 GHz but it doesn't want to boot. You'd have to increase your voltage more 'till it boots. 

Voltage too high and you still can't reach 4.5 GHz? You have to decrease your CPU speed till it boots at your maximum safe voltage.

Still want less voltage/heat? Decrease your voltage and CPU speed accordingly until you reach an overclock that meets your performance-temperature-voltage expectations. 

Some people don't need 4.5GHz so they are perfectly fine with 4.2 GHz at (or less than) 1.19V. Some people are nuts and want crazy overclock so they run 4.7GHz at 1.35V. 


TL;DR: There is no ""set way"" to get overclocking down to a science due to variances in silicon, parts, temperatures, etc, etc, etc.

Hey there Redditors,

I'm sure we've all seen it before: a new show or movie comes out, and the fans are so excited that they can't help but share their enthusiasm with the world. They post about it on social media, write reviews, and share their thoughts with anyone who will listen. And while it's great to be passionate about something, sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming.

That's why I'm here to ask you: when it comes to new shows and movies, keep it to yourselves sometimes, fanbases. Let the show do the talking! Don't spoil the plot, don't share your theories, and don't give away too much information. Let the show speak for itself, and let the audience discover it on their own.

In fact, I think what's-his-face—Eric Kripke?—acknowledged the heavy influence of that book on the show. I also like the nods to the Joss Whedon playbook, like the way they give you a lighter episode before hitting you with something heavy. I could do without them killing off characters I love, though. 

But mostly I like it because it's glaringly obvious that they have a crapton of fun making it. Just this season there was the Randy Raccoon preschool or something. There's a Serenity Valley Convalescent Home in there somewhere. The Rise of Dick, fer cryin' out loud! And the episode titled ""Mannequin 3: The Reckoning."" That title just tickles the shit outta me, and the 80s movie music . . . you just *know* that the writers and music supervisor(s) had a high old time with that one. The fun they all have with it just oozes out all over the whole damn show.

Almost forgot: they are champions of breaking the fourth wall in small, entertaining ways. They struck gold earlier this season with ""Wait--are you the new Bobby?"" and ""Have we eaten yet?"" in one episode. 

**TL;DR:** Supernatural is a damn fine show, and those of us who aren't creepy fangirls shouldn't watch it in secret. We should trumpet our very sane and reasonable enjoyment of it and make the *fangirls* be the ones who feel ashamed!

Shit. Ima hafta watch me some Supernatural now.

There's one other thing I love that I'm reluctant to bring up because, well, it smacks of crazy fangirl if I don't explain it properly. But fuck it. I feel safe with y'all. Just go with me on this, ok?

I freaking love Jensen Ackles. Not because he's pretty, but for his little twitches of pure, subtle comedy.

Or when he mentions that one of the Ramones is buried in a certain cemetery: Sam asks if they're going to dig him up, and Dean replies, with *perfect* inflection, ""Bite your tongue, heathen!""

He also delivers my favorite line in the whole series, and it's the delivery that makes me love it so: ""Puddiiiinnnnng!""

If you're looking to open a new hookah lounge, it can be a daunting task. With smoking bans popping up in many cities, it can be hard to find a place to open a lounge without breaking the bank. The hardest part about opening a new one at this point is avoiding smoking bans.

Luckily, there are still some ways to go about it. First, research the laws in your area. Make sure you know the exact laws and regulations for smoking in your city. This will help you find a place to open your lounge that won't violate any laws.

Second, look for a place that is not in a high-traffic area. This will help you avoid any potential issues with the local authorities.

Finally, make sure you have a good business plan. Do your research and make sure you have a plan that will make your lounge a success.

Opening a new hookah lounge can be a difficult process, but if you are smart about it you can do it without breaking the bank. The hardest part about opening a new one at this point is avoiding smoking bans, but with a bit of research and planning you can make it happen. Good luck!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/hookah with title ""If you are smart about it you can do it without breaking the bank. The hardest part about opening a new one at this point is avoiding smoking bans.""","Permitting depends on where you are. I got an EIN, State sales permit, city permits for tobacco, non-intoxicating beverages, and vending. Besides that the big one for me was a wisconsin tobacco products distributor license. That allowed me to buy tobacco from other states and pay the proper taxes, but there are also distributors that may pay your state's applicable taxes. Again the permits you need will vary state to state so make sure to check your local laws. If you have a smoking ban in your state you may be SOL.

Expenses, the best I can from memory, were as follows: Realize I was trying to get this off as cheaply as possible and then spend more on it as I made it. You could definitely spend more on equipment and furniture, but I don't see the reason. If your clientele ends up being like mine they will just have somewhere cool to go and won't care if the couch is brand new designer, or second hand with a cover. This is rough estimations below. Also I was in a 1000+ sqft location that seated 25-35 to start furniture costs go up with more space :P

* Stainless sink, fridge, and stainless work tables - (all used) ~2-3K
* Couches, chairs, tables - (As much quality used as possible and filled in the gaps with some cheap new) ~ 2-3k
* Cash register - (I now use an ipad with square and a cash drawer) 100-1000
* Hookahs, supplies, &amp; tobacco (for use and sale) ~ 2-3K
* legal fees and permitting ~ 2k

Other stuff is any buildout or remodeling, paint, decorations, music apparatus, and depends on the state of the building you rent. I also rented an ice maker in the beginning rather than buying, but this is also something you can find relatively cheap used on CL. Finally you could avoid the fridge by instead buying or renting an old canned soda vending machine and using that. Also for music I contacted a local coin-op vender and 'rented' (they take 50% of the take) a jukebox and a dig dug machine and it cost me nothing up front. You also want to make sure you have enough squirreled away for the first few months of rent and bills and advertising. Hope this helps a bit. 

TLDR; If you are smart about it you can do it without breaking the bank. The hardest part about opening a new one at this point is avoiding smoking bans."

Whether it's a shitty site with a terrible layout is debatable (I personally don't think it is). Does it have zero credibility in metal? Absolutely not.

There are certain websites out there that have been around for years and have built up a solid reputation in the metal scene. These sites often feature reviews, interviews, and other content related to metal music and culture. Even if the site's layout isn't the best, the content is often top-notch and can provide valuable insight into the metal scene.

So, while a website's layout may not be the most aesthetically pleasing, it doesn't mean it has zero credibility in metal. Quality content is what really matters, and as long as a website provides that, it can still be a valuable source of information for metalheads.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/thrashmetal with title ""Whether it's a shitty site with a terrible layout is debatable (I personally don't think it is). Does is have zero credibility in metal? Absolutely not.""","Okay, I've read through your comments, and I can only assume that you have no friends that like metal, nor have you ever actually been to a metal gig or even met another metalhead. You've formed all your opinions in some weird bubble and argue things that are generally accepted by all metalheads as if they aren't.

I've withheld from commenting on your ridiculous posts because I think there are others here, like noodle, fighting the good fight far more eloquently than I ever could. However, this time I cannot help myself. Saying metal archives has zero credibility in the metal world makes no sense. Say what you will about the layout (I've had my issues with it in the past - many of which have recently been addressed with the latest version), but the metal archives has been one of the most valuable resources for the underground at large for the last decade or more. There is no other database out there, electronic or otherwise, that has as massive a metal catalogue, that for the most part is neatly organized into several different search terms, including genre, country, label, and more. Similar to Wikipedia, it is user edited, but on a points system - you must have a certain number of points in order to edit things, which you get by submitting reviews. On top of that, all reviews and all edits are closely moderated by some very dedicated people - the better written the review, the more points you get. This means that the only people that are submitting to and editing the metal archives are dedicated metalheads. 

In all my discussions with metalheads and travels to gigs all across the globe, I have NEVER met a person who hasn't ever used the archives. I personally do not know where I would be without having it to reference. When I hear of a new band, the first thing I do is check their archives page. It is the best and easiest way to get a glimpse and determine whether it's a band worth looking into. Or maybe I'm just trying to remember the name of an album or the name of a band member or I want to look up lyrics. Metal archives is the quickest and easiest way to achieve that, and everyone in metal knows it. 

TL;DR: Whether it's a shitty site with a terrible layout is debatable (I personally don't think it is). Does is have zero credibility in metal? Absolutely not.

Recently, Riot Games has banned a professional League of Legends player for showing toxic behavior in-game. While the ban was justified, many people have been questioning the way Riot handled the situation. In my opinion, Riot should have given the player more of a chance to reform his behavior before taking such a drastic measure. A suspension would have been more appropriate in this situation, and would have also given the player a chance to learn from his mistakes and become a better player. It's understandable that Riot wants to maintain a professional environment, but punishing someone for a single mistake isn't the correct way to go about it.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/leagueoflegends with title ""Ban justified, correct way to handle the situation from Riot? Imo no!""","I agree with you in most of what you said. The problem I see is that football players now that they will get ""banned"" for doing shit and behaving like douches. 

We dont know if IWDominate knew that he can get banned from professional gaming. He knew that his account may get permabanned but that is his personal problem. 

Imho its right to ban players from professional games if they act like IWDominate did but you should get a warning like: ""Hey IWDominate change your behaviour or we will ban you from the professional scene"".

Tl;dr: Ban justified, correct way to handle the situation from Riot? Imo no!"

If Riot really wants to enforce such harsh punishments on the pro players that made their game famous in the first place, then they should hold all pro players to the same standards. It's not fair to single out certain players for their mistakes, while others go unpunished for similar offenses. 

Also, people should stop getting so upset about words. It's natural for people to have disagreements and heated debates, but that doesn't mean that it's okay to be rude or insulting. If someone says something that you don't like, then it's best to just ignore it and move on. People should be allowed to express their opinions without fear of being attacked or punished.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/leagueoflegends with title ""If Riot really wants punishment this harsh for the pro players that made their game famous in the first place they should hold all pro players to the same standards. Also stop getting upset about words, people.""","It's definately a good step to ""clean up"" in high elo territory for once, especially when players get money from Riot to be a professional gamer and represent their game.

  On the other hand though, the times I've seen IWD on streams he wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary. There's joking trash talking in almost all games and since the introduction of the Tribunal everybody has grown really thin-skinned.

Now I don't say that what he did was right but a year long ban is also a grave punishment for somebody who relies on tournament earnings (aka pro players). Being probably 10 years above the age of the average league player I don't really get upset about flaming (which seems to be what IWD has been banned for); everyone has bad games/days every now and then and of course, you only hear about the bad ones on the Tribunal.

On the other hand you have players like Dyrus who troll and feed on purpose (on a stream with 10k viewers no less) or just afk/ragequit games. As a player I'd rather have somebody on my team who's raging at me for making a mistake (nobody rages at somebody for no reason to be honest) than somebody who's actively working for the other team to win. Of course, we won't see any punishment for Dyrus though because Riot loves TSM for some reason (also inb4 fanboy downvotes).

TL;DR: If Riot really wants punishment this harsh for the pro players that made their game famous in the first place they should hold all pro players to the same standards. Also stop getting upset about words, people. "

It seems like Riot Games is trying to make League of Legends into a more 'happy joy land' style game that appeals to the majority of players. While this may be successful in the short term, it is doomed to fail in the long run. The most competitive players will never accept a game that is designed to appeal to the masses. League of Legends is a game that requires skill and strategy, and the most competitive players will always be looking for a challenge. By trying to make the game more accessible to the masses, Riot Games is taking away the challenge that makes the game so appealing to the most competitive players. This is a poor decision, and it will ultimately lead to the game failing to meet the expectations of its most dedicated players.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/leagueoflegends with title ""Poor decision by riot trying to make a purely competitive pvp style game into happy joy land style game that appeals to the majority (masses), as this will never be successful d/t the nature of the most competitive players. This may be their focus in this game and people will adapt at that level for now, however this will be the nature of all very high competitive players forever."""," I will start by stating I have been a Riot supporter since day 1, starting with beta and introducing many many people to the game. I truly have believed in what riot's mission has been thus far.

However, Riot did destroy his league career. You think LoL will be around as the most competitive game for another 5 years? Think again, this year is the single most important year to date, and will determine whether this is a feasible approach to eSports professional gaming. Of which IWD has put in substantial time and effort in helping develop the pro scene to this point as he has been a part of it for an extensive amount of time. 

Gaming has, and always will be full of gamers. Since the beginning of gaming, people get hyped/emotional/jabber mouthed/etc. when things do not go as intended. This ranges from a 2 year old to a 50 year old.

I have not been punished by the tribunal on any of my accounts, ever. However from the start of tribunal being implemented in the way it is, it started off being a GREAT idea, and quickly was realized that not all god ideas are implemented properly. 

This was the start, since first time since playing this game over 3 years ago that I have been disappointed with Riot. And this very harsh implementation only leaves me with a taste in my mouth that riot is pushing more towards catering to its masses (not top 20% elo) players, just as WoW did in its beginning after Blackwing lair I believe it was called. They made everything easy mode and more accessible to the casual gamer and continued to do so from what I've been told. 

I see this game doing the same thing in a different way, punishing players by perma-banning is already excessive considering the amount of time and money put in by the individual. This in itself is trying to change the nature of online gaming, competitive gamers as I stated above have historically had a raging nature. That is why they are playing a PURELY PVP based game. 

The root disruption of the game in my opinion is not typing ragers, you have plenty of options if your feelings are hurt by keystrokes. The biggest problem is people who do not communicate in team select/afk-ragequitter's. This disrupts the game the most, I have had plenty of ragers in my games and there is a mute button for each player in the game that any moron can figure out. If your feelings are hurt so much in a competitive environment I suggest you stick to candyland because regardless of Riot's stance on this, this behavior towards less skilled players will be in EVERY competitive style game til the end of gaming. The best players, want to win. 

TL;DR Poor decision by riot trying to make a purely competitive pvp style game into happy joy land style game that appeals to the majority (masses), as this will never be successful d/t the nature of the most competitive players. This may be their focus in this game and people will adapt at that level for now, however this will be the nature of all very high competitive players forever.

Hey everyone, 

I'm looking for some advice on a job I'm applying for, and I'm hoping to get some insight from the SEO experts here. 

I'm applying for a position in the digital marketing field and I'm hoping to land it. I've done plenty of research and I'm confident I have the skills and experience needed to succeed. 

However, I'm not sure if I'm doing enough to stand out from the competition. Someone sourced Neil Patel in one of the responses, so I figured I should take a look at what he has to say. 

Does anyone have any other advice on how I can make myself stand out from the competition? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Good luck. I hope you land it.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/SEO with title ""enough as it is.

 Good luck. I hope you land it.""","I'm the SEM/SEO manager for an ecommerce company that does almost 200 million annually. I've been on the other end of the presentations and here's some stuff i would look for.

Siegoboy's comments are really good if the company is starting SEO from scratch. 

For a company that's been actively building their SEO, i think you want to provide more details on the value added you provide.

Identify problem points in their SEO efforts and talk about the current environment. Don't rip them apart, because you want to make them feel positive as well, but talk about what you can do to contribute. Saying 'We want to start this from scratch! or We want to re-do this"" basically = lots of work or lots of money and taking steps backwards and that the guy in charge of the program (the one who will be hiring you) is incompetent. More likely, he/she/they will understand where you're coming from but will have a different idea of where priorities should lie.
Unless something they're doing is completely wrong, don't offer to redo anything. Ie, blogs, content, URL structure. Rather - try to add to what they're doing instead (unless it's a complete mess).

If they are doing 100 million, then they have other systems tied to the site and there are other factors that are preventing them from improving their site or it's a bigger job than you think because other departments will need to get involved. Ie. content could reside in IT instead of marketing or vice versa meaning they have to go through gatekeepers to get changes implemented.
Simple changes like title tags etc which would take a few mins on a smaller site could take weeks to get done on a larger company's site.

Although, you shouldn't guarantee any performance (because that will just raise flags), set goals based on what you think you can accomplish. Whether that is traffic goals, conversions, ranking etc. - is up to you. This will help them get an idea of what they will get back on their investment. In the end SEO is another channel. Most people understand it takes time to see results from SEO but visually showing what the forecasted growth will look like is something i request in all my RFPs. This forecast and the tactics used to get there are what i look at most closely when i am looking at proposals from agencies.

Talk about some of the tactics you will be using to get to your proposed forecasts and try to get into some detail. Ie. don't just say link building $1000 - say linkbuilding allocating this amount of funds into content creation, this much into getting X number of high PR sites per month, X number of mid PR sites, and $X into directories or whatever.

Don't worry about the company taking your ideas and running with it themselves. if they're this large, they have the resources to do everything in-house if they wanted to but it's not worth the resources they will need to put into it. Hiring an agency will allow them to implement and hit the ground running rather than building it up internally.

If they're new to SEO, offer a site audit to kick things off and make this a big part of the presentation because it will highlight your expertise and also show where their investment is going. 

If they are SEO veterans, mention the site audit outlining what's involved but don't make a big deal out of it. Chances are they've done/had numerous audits and another one will just look like a waste of time.

Realize that a site that does $100 million will be slow to act. There's going to be release cycles, and other projects that are bigger priority than SEO so factor that into your recommendations and projects.

Low hanging fruit is very attractive - so make sure you highlight those. Things that you can implement quickly (sometimes site related, but off-site might be better if they will be slower to make changes).

Offering to take on some of the on-site work is very attractive but can also backfire. This usually means opening up code and dev environments to your team which may be backlash on from those who manage those areas.

I'm sure there's more stuff but this reply is TLDR enough as it is.

Someone sourced Neil Patel in one of the responses - you should definately take a look at what he says.

It's easy to get caught up in the theoretical aspects of the game, but it's important to remember that there's a difference between theory and a theory with support. You can't say that a tachyon actually exists as anything more than a theory. Sure, it's possible in theory, but without actual evidence and proof, it's just a theoretical concept. The same goes for strategies and hero builds in Dota 2. You can come up with a theoretically sound strategy, but without actually playing it out and testing it, it's just a theory. Theory is great for brainstorming, but it's the practical application of these theories that make them viable in competitive play.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/DotA2 with title ""there's a difference between theory and a theory with support.

I mean essentially everything we cannot immediately observe is considered just a theory, but most of our science past that point is extrapolated by taking said theory as truth. While the black hole may technically be hypothetical, it has backing and we've advanced with that assumption, and everything still follows the laws of physics. A tachyon on the other hand has no support, no true contribution, as well as a direct violation of the laws of physics.

Proliferation concerns have been a major obstacle to the development of new nuclear technologies, particularly the Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR) and the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR). But these concerns are overblown.

The LFTR and IFR are inherently less proliferation-prone than current nuclear technologies due to their closed fuel cycle, which reduces the amount of plutonium produced. Additionally, LFTRs and IFRs can be designed to produce only small amounts of fissile material, making them much more difficult to divert for weapons use.

Furthermore, the LFTR and IFR are much more efficient than current nuclear technologies, which means that much less nuclear material is needed to produce the same amount of energy. This further reduces the potential for proliferation.

In short, proliferation concerns should not be a major obstacle to the development of the LFTR and IFR. We should stop worrying and embrace these new technologies, as they offer a much safer and more efficient alternative to current nuclear technologies.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/energy with title ""Proliferation concerns aren't that big of a deal. Stop worrying and love the LFTR (and the IFR).""","Ugh. If any state really wants a nuclear weapon (and is willing to pay the consequences in international relations), it can build a graphite moderated, water-cooled natural uranium reactor and run the rods on a short fuel cycle and then reprocess. All of the materials required to do the above are available anywhere. This is 1940s technology and is the method that all modern US nuclear weapons [were built with]( And it could easily be done underground so that it is hard to detect from space. 

North Korea built one of these above ground but was forced to stop doing it when the [US threatened to do air strikes]( Of course, they could have rebuilt this infrastructure underground and not told anyone until they make enough bombs. Who knows.

The other methods pretty much suck. Enriching uranium is a pain in the ass because isotopic separation is complex and slow (the US only does this for power reactors these days because we naively think not using the practically limitless energy of plutonium power reactors like the Integral Fast Reactor in our country will prevent proliferation in other countries). And using a LFTR to separate out protactinium is incredibly stupid because you then lose the fuel to needed maintain the reactors breeding ratio to produce more material. The breeding ratios of LFTRs [aren't very high]( so if you remove the stuff that decays into fuel then you have to put more fuel in to keep the reactor going (which means enriched uranium, plutonium, or more U-233). This is basic physics. LFTRs are also much more complex than the Chicago Pile/Hanford B reactor (note: this doesn't mean they aren't a million times better for power production, they just require more engineering effort and industrial production for materials like Hallestoy-N).

The thing is that states like Iran and North Korea really don't want to make these materials in mass. If they do, it would be seen as a major threat by the powers that be and would be pretext for a JDAM tossing party by 'Murica. They want to do just enough to keep their capabilities ambiguous so they feel big and bad while still preventing invasion. But they don't want to do anything too over the top because that is suicide (this is why Iran publicly stated it stopped uranium enrichment at 20%, they just wanted to show they had the turnkey capability to make weapons, not that they'd actually do it). And further, nuclear materials aren't enough by themselves. The USA and USSR invested enormous amounts of money that Iran and Best Korea don't have in delivery systems (MIRVed ICBMs with advanced inertial and celestial guidance systems, stealth bombers, terrain mapping cruise missiles, missile subs, the [Davy Fuckin' Crockett]( the dreaded and banned-by-treaty [Fractional Orbital Bombardment System]( and probably even Goldeneyes :) and weapons design/testing to perfect their Armageddon-bringing capabilities. If the remaining members of the Axis of Evil actually used a bomb, they would be completely obliterated (i.e. their entire population will look like the guy that was microwaved like in Kick-Ass) while the other side would just suffer some relatively minor damage (note: although many people died there in 1945, Hiroshima still exists and thrives today). 

So yeah, the Iranians might desire to have the ability to prevent invasion, but the steps to get there involve invoking invasion before they are capable of defending themselves. So, don't expect the status quo to change. The only reason NK crossed the initial threshold is because Kim Jong Il wanted to compensate for his many inadequacies, but no one considers the NK bomb a significant real world threat. But even then, they can't get their rockets to fire straight and may be crazy, but aren't suicidal.

The only place I really worry about is Pakistan. If some corrupt idiots in their government leaks a few kg of enriched uranium (which can be trivially made into a crude nuke using the gun design) to some religious nut, India is gonna have a pretty bad time. Of course, that will probably trigger the destruction of Pakistan, so hopefully the corrupt idiots will keep that in mind before going through with that. What really worries me is what if the corrupt idiots are also themselves religious nuts. Then we have a problem that isn't easily fixable.

TL;DR: Proliferation concerns aren't that big of a deal. Stop worrying and love the LFTR (and the IFR)."

I recently bought a new Chevrolet and have been having a few problems with it. One of them is a leak in the engine that has been there since the day I bought it. I took it to the dealership and they said they could fix it, but it would cost me. I agreed and they fixed it. 

Fast forward a few months and the leak is back. I took it back to the dealership and they said they would fix it, but only if I paid for it. I explained that I had already paid for it and they said that the warranty had run out and that I would have to pay for it again. 

I am so frustrated with Chevrolet and their technicians. How can they hire technicians that don't know how to fix a problem and then not stand behind their work? It's ridiculous and I'm never going to buy a Chevrolet again. Fuck you Chevrolet for hiring stupid technicians and being completely able to fix leaks until the warranty runs out at which point you tell people to go pound sand.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/WTF with title ""Fuck you Chevrolet for hiring stupid technicians and being completely able to fix leaks until the warranty runs out at which point you tell people to go pound sand.""","I had a similar experience once.

Now, a little back story on this car.  It has less than 10k miles on it, has been taken care of, and has come back from the factory three times with the same damn leak that was supposedly fixed.  Basically, one of the windows allows moisture in.  This means it has a nice moldy smell all the time and bugs can get in.  Also, the air bag doesn't work, the speakers don't work, etc.  2007 Chevrolet Cobalt if you must know, out of warranty.

Anyway.


I was driving to the store in this car, which belonged to my parents, as my mom had no license and my dad had advanced lou gehrig's disease and couldn't drive anyway.  I get there and load up the groceries in the trunk.  I start back.  Before I'm even out of the parking lot, I reach into the back seat to grab my jacket because I was getting cold.  I felt something on my hand and looked back.

My entire arm was covered in ants.  There were hundreds, nay, thousands of them.

Thankfully there was a gas station in the same parking lot so I high tailed it over there and began to vacuum out the ants.  There was a book in the back seat, and the entirety of the book and all surrounding parts was ant nest.  It took me a good hour to suck them all up with the vacuum.  They had infested my jacket, too, so that got a good vacuuming too and a trip through the wash when I got home.

TLDR; Fuck you Chevrolet for hiring stupid technicians and being completely able to fix leaks until the warranty runs out at which point you tell people to go pound sand.

Hey everyone,

I recently had a terrifying experience while driving. I was driving along when I suddenly noticed a spider crawling across my dashboard. I almost had a heart attack!

To avoid a similar experience in the future, I have come up with a few tips that might help you avoid the same situation.

1. Make sure to check your car before you get in and start driving. This will help you spot any unwanted guests before they have a chance to surprise you.

2. If you do happen to find a spider in your car, try to stay calm and pull over as soon as possible. This will help you avoid any potential accidents.

3. If you can't pull over, try to keep your eyes on the road and focus on driving safely. Don't let the spider distract you.

Hopefully these tips will help you avoid a similar experience to mine. Stay safe out there!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/WTF with title ""Tips to hopefully stop you killing me from by finding a spider in your car whilst driving.""","Gotta love Australia.

Tips though. Wash your car (inside and out) frequently. Less shit in the car means less hiding spots plus chances are you're leaving food wrappers that attract ants and other bugs, which is partly the reason spidey is hangin around. 

Pressure wash the outside, don't forget mirrors, door gaps and wheel arches etc. If you are extra paranoid get the engine bay too. Doesn't take long.

Not using the car for a while? Close the vents and hit recirculate. 

Also don't park contacting any trees or bushes, ever.

Boo to dicks like this.

I recently encountered someone who, when asked about their religious beliefs, proudly proclaimed that they were an atheist. When asked why, they said that they believed that all religions were equally false, and that anyone who believed in any religion was an idiot.

It's attitudes like this that give atheists a bad name. Atheism is simply a lack of belief in a god or gods, not a statement about the truth or falsity of any religion. We don't need to be attacking people of faith to make our point. We can simply live our lives without any gods, and let others do the same.

It seems like every day, there's a new story about North Korea, or something related to South Korea, that makes headlines and sparks outrage and indignation. It's understandable. But let's take a breath and look at the facts before we rush to judgement and start calling for action.

Yes, it's important to be aware of what's happening and to hold those in power accountable. But let's at least figure out what's going on before we grab the pitchforks, and cool it with the ""FOR KOREA"" stuff. We need to know the truth before we can make any real progress.

Dumbledore is one of the most powerful wizards in the Harry Potter universe, and his power can be expressed in a number of ways, including through violent force. On the other hand, Gandalf's power lies in his wisdom and guidance, which are much less destructive. In a battle between the two, it's clear that Dumbledore would win because he has the ability to use his power in a violent manner, while Gandalf's power is limited to providing advice and guidance. What do you think?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""Dumbledore wins because his power can be expressed violently whereas Gandalf's power is wisdom and guidance""","Dumbledore would win under most conditions. I know that seems a little controversial given the other comments, but hear me out. 

He'd win because he is human. Well, it's a little more complicated than that, but that's the gist of it. Gandalf isn't human. He's a maiar in the form of an old man. In plainspeak, he's an angel. Because he such a being, his influence is relatively weak. He can guide and teach but he cannot rule. He can only do those things if he went rogue, like Saruman and even then, Saruman's power wasn't magic, but cunning and strategy. 

Dumbledore isn't bound by those rules. If he wanted to make the floor into a dragon, he could damn well do it. If he wanted Gandalf's insides to boil away, he could to that too. 

The conditions ultimately come down to what Gandalf's superiors want. If they want him to defeat Dumbledore, they'll send him back until he does, like with the Balrog. But since this is simply being on being and without back up, it's pretty definitive that Dumbledore would win.

I recently had a player ask me why regeneration doesn't do anything until the point where state-based actions would kill the creature. I explained that regeneration works differently than other abilities because it is a replacement effect. It replaces the destruction of the creature with a new effect, which is to tap the creature and remove all damage from it. This means that if the creature would be destroyed due to state-based actions, regeneration will take effect before that destruction happens, thus preventing the creature from being destroyed.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/magicTCG with title ""regeneration doesn't do anything until the point where state-based actions  would  kill the creature.""","When an ability like ""regenerate this creature"" resolves, all it does is wait until the creature would die that turn.

THEN, if it would die, at the that time, it prevents that. In order for that to matter, it does a few extra things.

First, it removes all damage. That's important, otherwise a creature regenerating from lethal damage would immediately die again.

Then, it does two other things which basically allow a player to remove the creature for a turn even if it does regenerate. Those two things are: tap the creature (if it has not yet attacked at the time it would die, it can't normally attack after regenerating) and remove it from combat (if it hasn't already done combat damage, that would keep it from dealing combat damage). These other two effects aren't things it needs to do, they're just effects that balance regeneration, and perhaps add a little flavor.

TL;DR: regeneration doesn't do anything until the point where state-based actions *would* kill the creature."

I'm in a difficult situation. I'm in a relationship with someone I care about deeply, but our relationship has been unhealthy for a while.

Finland will not be getting any Mitsubishi vehicles in the near future. The Japanese carmaker has announced it will not be exporting its vehicles to the Nordic country due to the high cost of production and the small size of the Finnish car market. This means that consumers in Finland will have to look elsewhere for their car needs.

This is a disappointing news for Mitsubishi fans in Finland, as the company has a long history of producing reliable and affordable vehicles. However, with the current economic climate, Mitsubishi has decided that it is not cost-effective to export its vehicles to Finland.

Marriage is an institution for those who need evidence of love. However, love is better expressed through the act of itself. Plus, who doesn't love playing with a Chinchilla? They're so cute and fluffy, and they certainly rule!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/funny with title ""Marriage is an institution for those who need evidence of love. However, [love is better expressed through the act of itself.]( Plus, gonna play with a Chinchilla. Chinchilla's rule.""","People are so freaking paranoid...

Can anyone tell me, besides the legal reasons, why Marriage is important? Does anyone spiritually sincerely believe dancing in circles in front of dead gods will legitimize a bond that you feel for another human being? There is no boundary which keeps people, in the afterlife or without, together that could expresses love any more or less. The act of marriage is a tradition which solidifies possession over individuals, which doesn't sound like, ""to honor, to cherish"". Inviting family and friends, however wonderful a community gathering could be, is a con for gifts and to ward off any male or female predators. The only joy I could possibly foresee is the Bride's, ""One Day"", but that is reinforcing a HUGE negative social stereotype which is capturing the absolute beauty of a woman in her prime, her aesthetics, and her youth. After that day, THAT'S IT! Either back to yoga to keep up obsessing over a wedding dress that you will never wear again for the rest of your life or always wondering if you could COMPARE TO YOUR WEDDING DAY. You know the most beautiful I've ever seen a woman? It was after my buddy's kid was born. His partner was so freaking beautiful in intention, motivation, and was in complete aww over a tangible journey which lead to the most beautiful life on this planet. But when she got out of the hospital, only myself and their parents were there to help and be a part of their lives. I wouldn't say that they need to rush the couple, but the community could do more for the lives of those they supposedly cherish than to sit, kneel, stand, aww, eat, drink, dance, cheers, and go home. I would want people involved in the most important moments in my partner's and my lives rather than creating an intangible moment to the dead gods to ward off any other male predators so that I could, how did you put it, ""lock that down"".

Legally, makes sense. That's a commitment. Spiritually, unless it's deeply personal and a completely intimate connection with everyone involved, not a fucking preacher you've met twice before and to impress your Bosses Boss or your distant Aunt that lent you some money because she has no children of her own and, ""It would be nice to give her some attention, considering..."", then what's the point.

Shit, since I'm already on this rant, Sex. Fuck people before marriage. The body is sacred, which is why you SHOULD test drive it before ""committing to owning"". The reason is not because you should know how it feels, (because it feels pretty fucking good or it's awful, never really a middle ground about it), but because in those soft, silent moments after is the ground which make the earth tremble, the moments of bliss which will sincerely connect you to your partner. God DAMN nothing feels better than having finished mutually and then discussing about your lives, fears, woes, joys, memories, expectations, and hopes. Worst case, if the relationship doesn't work out. then you have come to understand better who 'you' wish to be better and with 'whom' you wish to be better with! WHAT A FUCKING CONCEPT!

Do you wish to commit to the partner that you love? Get legally whatever makes you safe from society, and then commit to each other in the knowledge that, no matter how ever much you both change, that the only person in this world that is important enough to share it with is your partner. No ""official notice"", no community peer pressure, but by acknowledging the joy you both feel for one another every single day, because through the uncertainty of life, there is a stronger love for those who know rather than who need evidence... scratch that... who need a shiny rock as proof rather than the boundless experiences of every day with each other as evidence of your commitment towards one another.

I'm going to love my partner so much when I get home.

Then we'll play with our pet Chinchilla as she bites our toes and hides in our blanket as we snuggle on the floor while we watch M.A.S.H. (RADAR!), then after sweeping, cleaning out her cage, and finishing the dishes, we'll fall asleep in each other's arms, knowing that this was also the happiest day of our entire lives as well, and looking forwards to tomorrow.

No, economics of scale will not always exist. In fact, the more decentralised a system is, the more it can resist the effects of economies of scale. In a decentralised system, each individual unit is relatively small and can provide the same services or goods as larger units, but without the same fixed costs associated with larger production. This allows for competition and innovation at the local level, which can lead to greater efficiency and lower costs for consumers. In addition, decentralised systems can be more resilient to external shocks and disruptions, as they are not as dependent on a single source of goods or services. Therefore, decentralisation can be a powerful tool for resisting the effects of economies of scale.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Anarchism with title ""no, economics of scale will not always exist.""","My point is that as an engineer and roboticist, I am telling you, you **can** effectively do away with the things that can not be decentralized.

I cant wait for the video we are working on to be done so I don't have to keep typing this, This is [The Technocopia Plan](

Imagine a building, lets say 1000 ft/square with 12 ft ceilings (a bit tall for normal, but it makes the math for the square footage round). In this space you have a machine, this machine takes in air and energy and can make things like food, water purifiers, air wells, composite fiber board, manufactured plastics, electronics, computers, solar panels, LED's even electric bikes. Some things need to be put together like Ikia furniture, some are assembled.  No metals, or minerals, but really no need for them either. This will produce enough food (pescetarian) for one person permanently.

Now the neatest trick this thing will do is make an exact copy of itself as well as the other things. This means if you need more stuff then the machine can provide, you make another one. In fact, since there is no cost and very little labor to build new ones, you generally would keep a spare ready to go, just in case. These machines can be kept individual, or in your local community center to encourage communal meals and collaborative inventing and creativity. 

Inside the machine on one end is a small vertical aquaponics farm where the veggies, fish and raw material for the rest of the industrial processes comes from. The materials digesters turn bio mass into plastics, graphene electronics and semiconductors, and a whole host of composites. Next level is the manufacturing, of which 3d printing is one part.  Robotics manages the interactions between the stages, takes care of the plants and feeds out the ordered items. You use one of the computers made by the machine to design new things, upload them to the internet to share with everyone with a similar machine, and ultimately print out on your local manufacturing system. 

We have started building the first level of this and meet online every week to discuss progress, if your interested in participating PM me.

I recently made the switch from a 400L to a 200L and I'm so glad I did. I was originally looking for a lens to expand my kit and give me more range, but I quickly realized that the 400L was just too expensive for what I was getting. Instead, I opted for the 200L which I was able to purchase for only $600. 

The 200L has given me plenty of range and I'm able to get the shots I need without breaking the bank. Plus, if I ever need more megapixels I can always add on a couple of teleconverters to get the job done. 

So if you're looking to expand your kit and you're on a budget, I'd recommend skipping the 400L and going for the 200L. It's a great lens and it won't break the bank. 

Happy shooting!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/photography with title ""Skip the 400L. Buy a 200L (and 2x TC only if you print and need the megapixel count).  I bought my 200L for $600.""","Buy a used 200L instead of the 400L. I have owned both. 

The 200L is two stops wider than the 400 and has half the focal length. Because of this the light required to get a sharp image is about 4 stops lower (2 stops aperture, 2 stops shutter speed). You can use your 200L when the sun starts going down. That's advantage 1. 

The 200L is much lighter and smaller than the 400L. Advantage 2. 

The 200L is, give or take, half the price of the 400L. Advantage 3. 

The 200mm focal length has more uses than the 400L. Advantage 4. 

The kicker? The 400L is tack sharp. Holy Jesus or Unholy Satin, I don't know who did this, but my 200L has 90% of the sharpness at 2:1 magnification that the 400L has at 1:1. It's ridiculous. Remember how I said I have owned both? I sold my 400L because my 200 could resolve almost the same amount of detail. With a teleconverter (less money than the price difference), you could get a 200L and 90% of a 400L. That's why you should never buy a 400mm f/5.6L. 

As a side note, adding any teleconverters to a 400L will kill the autofocus. If you want maximum reach go with a 300mm f/4 IS. You can add a 1.4 TC for 420mm and keep the IS/AF. It's a bit pricier than the 400L though.

Graduating college is an exciting time, but it can also be a stressful one. You may be facing the prospect of student loan debt, or other financial obligations. That's why it's important to start building up a graduation nest egg now. 

Start by setting aside a small amount of money each month. Even if it's just $50 or $100, it will start to add up over time. If you can, try to increase the amount you save each month. 

You should also look into ways to reduce your expenses. Consider ways to reduce your rent, transportation costs, and other expenses. This will help you save more money for your nest egg. 

Finally, do your best to avoid taking on new debt. Try to pay for items with cash or a debit card. If you must use credit cards, make sure you pay off the balance each month. 

By taking these steps, you can ensure that you have a solid financial foundation as you enter the workforce. Good luck!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/personalfinance with title ""Just build up a graduation nest egg and do your best to avoid debt.""","I would advise that you just save you money. Make sure that when you're out of college and on your own you have a big ol pile of money to help you. You'll need all kinds of things you don't even know about right now and then if you don't have a job, you'll need them anyway and a bunch of rent money. Find a high yield savings or CD and park your cash. You will need it. If you can start your career in no debt, you will be in an excellent position moving forward. It will allow you to start saving/investing in earnest and you will make up any ""lost"" ground almost instantly.

Yes, AJFA is a masterpiece. It is the perfect blend of thrash, power metal, and hard rock that makes it one of Metallica's most beloved albums. The album has some of the band's most iconic songs, such as ""One"", ""Harvester of Sorrow"", and ""The Unforgiven"". It also features some of their most technically impressive songs, such as ""The Shortest Straw"" and ""Eye of the Beholder"". AJFA is an essential part of Metallica's discography and one of the greatest metal albums of all time.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Metallica with title ""Yes. AJFA is a masterpiece.""","Wait, is anyone actually disagreeing that *AJFA* is the fucking bomb? It's a refinement of six years of work and development as a band, and the undeniable pinnacle of songwriting achievement for Metallica. IMO it's their best album, and it's my favorite Metallica album, above even *Ride the Lightning* and *Master of Puppets*. It contains some of my favorite songs (""Dyers Eve,"" ""Harvester of Sorrow,"" ""Blackened,"" ""Eye of the Beholder,"") not just from Metallica, but in general, the entire world over. ""Dyers Eve"" holds particular significance for me, being not just my favorite Metallica song but one of my favorite songs ever--and a lot of that, frankly, came with my own emotional difficulties and certain resentments I held towards my own parents that came about when I really started to listen to and love Metallica (which have long since been resolved, but I digress.)

The fact that they were able to create songs with such powerful emotional resonance, combined with a technicality and progressiveness that's not just impressive for the sheer skill of the band but also for the remarkable taste and astounding melodicism with which they pull it all off, should be a testament to the quality of that material. Of extremely important note is the fact that they recorded it all with Jason Newsted, a new bassist they were still getting used to playing with, and in the wake of the tragedy arising from the passing of Cliff. The fact that in spite of such a loss (and, at the same time, such a gain--remember that, while he was no Cliff Burton, Jason was no slouch when it came to conjuring up magic on his bass, even if you can barely hear it in the mix) they were able to put together such an amazing album is, frankly, remarkable.

With all of the hate that gets tossed at Metallica from the metal community at large, it's often easy for people to forget that, for a long time, they really were the greatest metal band in the world. A single listen to any of the cuts off of *...And Justice For All* makes it completely obvious why that was. And while it's true that I'd rather listen to The Chasm or Bolt Thrower than Metallica's post-Black Album output (although I do love all of their stuff, *Lulu* excepted,) if I had to live on a desert island and could only take one metal album with me, ten times out of ten it would have to be *...And Justice For All.* At the time (this was 1988!) nobody else was really doing this kind of thing--combining this sort of extreme heaviness with all of the progressiveness, technicality and melody that they conjured up for *AJFA*. Remember that, in 1988, this was still groundbreaking stuff--Dream Theater wouldn't release an LP for another half-year (and when *When Dream and Day Unite* finally did come out, it *still* wasn't as good as this,) the rest of the progressive metal world was still busy trying to be Yes or Rush (not to knock prog metal though, because I love that shit, same goes for Yes and Rush) and the only things that could really come close at the time were Death's *Leprosy* and Slayer's *South of Heaven* (both released the same year and both, IMO, of near-equal quality.) While Megadeth was still doing Sex Pistols covers and Anthrax was quickly fading into outdatedness and irrelevance, Metallica was crafting an eternal masterpiece.

**TL;DR** Yes. AJFA is a masterpiece."

It's interesting to think about the dynamic between Bond and M in the recent James Bond films. In Skyfall, Bond gets injured in a mission and M makes the decision to replace him with Eve. Bond is obviously unhappy about this decision, but he still believes in himself and his ability to get the job done. M, on the other hand, doesn't seem to believe in Bond's abilities and makes a bad decision. This is a great example of how Bond's loyalty to M is tested and how M's faith in Bond is tested. It isn't about Bond getting hit or not, it's about who believes they have the ability to get the job done. Bond thinks he does, M makes a bad choice and chooses Eve.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/JamesBond with title ""It isn't about Bond getting hit or not. It is about who believes they have the ability to get the job done. Bond thinks he does, M makes a bad choice and chooses Eve.""","It's always a challenge to an important turning point like that: why didn't they just do it some other way? 

As a writer, you try to make it feel as though the characters feel their action is naturally the best thing for them to do or the thing they are compelled to do or the situation dictates this is the only thing they can do.

NOTE: All the rest of my comment are spoilers. 

Here you have three characters making a tight decision under duress. Bond, M and Eve. I believe thematically, this moment comes down to whether M trusts Bond to get the job done or not.

Eve is in position to take the shot but she abdicates her decision to M. She doesn't have the confidence to make this decision on her own. Her decision becomes: will she follow M's order to shoot if told to? It is almost a foregone conclusion as to what she will do as she has already placed control in M's hands. For her not to follow M's orders to shoot would be for her to choose her own course and she is just a cog on the wheel, not her own person like Bond.

Bond can hear what is going on in the ear piece, he knows the shot is set up. His decision is to keep fighting or try to duck out of the way so Eve has a clear shot. Bond keeps fighting because he believes in himself. He believes it is better for him to get the job done than to rely on someone else. If he thought it would be better to duck out of the way and let Eve take the shot he would have done it. Turns out he was right, Eve misses the bad guy entirely.

M is the one who has the fulcrum decision as her opportunity to have Eve take the shot has a very short shelf life. The choice is this: should she rely on Eve's marksmanship to take out the bad guy or on Bond's ability to beat the guy in hand-to-hand combat?

M chooses wrong, not because Bond gets hit, but because Eve misses the bad guy altogether and he gets away. M's choice to believe Eve had a better chance than Bond to get the job done was a bad choice. When she chooses this, she symbolically kills Bond with her lack of confidence in him. She spends the rest of the movie thematically making this up to Bond.

Bond ""dies"" and his self-confidence is destroyed for a time. We see him aimless, drunk and shiftless wandering through booze and women and not giving a damn if he dies. He has no purpose.

When MI6 is attacked Bond comes back because he believes he is the best guy to save the organization. Now he has a purpose. He is reborn and will show M he has what it takes to get the job done. The film has a motif on the value of self-confidence running though it and that is what helps to inform many of the plot turning points.

tl;dr: It isn't about Bond getting hit or not. It is about who believes they have the ability to get the job done. Bond thinks he does, M makes a bad choice and chooses Eve.

I recently bought a new version of an RPG game I already owned, and I must say that it was not as great as I was expecting. There were some minor improvements, but nothing that really made it stand out from the original. However, I think it is still worth a purchase for anyone who doesn't already own the old version. The graphics are improved, the game play is a bit smoother, and there are some new features that make it a bit more interesting. So, if you don't already own the old version, I'd say it's definitely worth picking up the new one.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/rpg_gamers with title ""New is not so great, but probably worth a purchase for anyone who doesn't already own old.""","I played through about half of the Enhanced Edition so far. 

I'm not particularly impressed with it. Most of the bugfixes duplicated those already available for free as mods. The new features are kinda neat, but very rarely useful. 

The only thing the enhanced edition really added that had any inpact of my enjoyment of the game were the new characters and the quests they were involved in - and I do not rate those very highly, either. Adoy's Enclave in particular felt just plain unfinished. The characters and their banter were okay for the most part.

However, despite all these negatives, the developers seem to be actively fixing the problems in a fairly rapid manner. Once (if) they are all fixed, I think it will be a worthy purchase, especially if you do not already own Baldur's Gate, or if you are not confident in your ability to install mods properly (which is absolutely trivial to do, but still).

TLDR; New is not so great, but probably worth a purchase for anyone who doesn't already own old."

""Electric bass pickups aren't designed for a lot of things, but some rules are meant to be broken. I've been experimenting with using electric bass pickups to record acoustic bass guitar. It's not the most conventional way of doing things, but it can yield some really interesting results.

I'm using a single coil pickup and running it through a preamp and then into my audio interface. The sound is a bit more compressed than a traditional acoustic bass, but I'm finding that it adds a unique character to the sound.

Has anyone else tried this? What has your experience been like?""","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Bass with title ""Electric bass pickups aren't designed for that, but some rules are meant to be broken.""","How well it turns out really just depends on your expectations...

You're not going to get an upright sound just by throwing a bow into the mix, obviously. But you can get some cool effects, without question.  There's a couple issues with doing this, namely:

* The fretboard on an electric bass isn't really radiused enough to play anything but the outer strings.
* The bow causes the string to vibrate in a different axis than the magnetic pickups on your bass were designed to pick up.  To expand on this: 

If you don't know (forgive me if you do!), magnetic guitar pickups work by creating a magnetic field that the string vibrates within when it is struck.  The locus for these vibrations is the pole pieces on your pickup.  When you hit a string, you are causing tiny electromagnetic changes in the flux field generated by the pickups' magnet, and this magnetic change is centered most strongly at the pole pieces for the pickup.  This is why you have one pole piece under each string, because it allows for the most efficient changes in electromagnetic flux, and thereby the most sensitive pickups.

Because of the orientation of the strings vs. the pole pieces, the part of the strings' vibration which is actually picked up by your pickups (and then translated into electromagnetic changes, and later becomes the sound you hear when amplified) is basically the ""vertical"" axis - meaning, *your pickups most strongly sense the movement of the string away from, and back towards, the top of the pole piece.* The flux field is changed by lateral ""side-to-side"" motion as well, but traditional magnetic pickups mostly respond to vertical vibration.  Have you ever been playing REALLY hard (particularly with a pick or something) and attacked a note, which initially dropped off but then had a volume swell back up? You've heard the effect of too much lateral vibration.

Nearly all electric bass technique creates *vertical* vibration in the strings.  Bowing, on the other hand, creates primarily *lateral* motion in the strings, and in addition to that it actually suppresses the vertical motion of the string. When you lift the bow from the string, the vertical motion is allowed to come back, which causes a volume swell.  [You can hear that in effect in this video, particular at 2:37.](

The NS electric upright bass has a pickup system designed to combat exactly this issue I described.  [Here's the pickup page]( and there's a bunch of youtube videos out there.  

Anyway, do whatever you want!  [It can be really beautiful.](


Tl;dr Electric bass pickups aren't designed for that, but some rules are meant to be broken."

It's been a few days since the incident, but I still can't stop thinking about it. I was talking to a coworker about the no cry challenge, and I thought it would be a funny conversation.

So, as most sad videos on here, other redditors are like ""if this made you cry you should see this."" So naturally, I watched about 45 minutes worth of sad videos and then I come across the no cry challenge. He asks what it was and I explain, and start to tell him about the saddest video from yesterday. I can't remember the name of it, but it was about 7 minutes long and it was a camera crew following and documenting the final moments of this man and his dog. The dog had cancer I believe. He had all of his friends say goodbye and him and his wife/girlfriend took the dog to the vet to have him put down and this man was just in tears, as was I. So I then proceed to tell him about the time when I had to go put my dog down because he needed a surgery we couldn't afford. I told him how much pain my dog was in, and how badly I was crying and how when the lady put the injection in, how I could slowly see peace coming into his eyes. At this point in the story, I happen to look up (we weren't really looking at each other because we were cleaning so I was completely oblivious to his reaction and just kept running my mouth) and he says please stop, I can't talk about this. And he turned around and had to compose himself for a few minutes. I felt AWFUL. I still feel awful. It got really awkward and we didn't really talk much for the last few hours. I was fighting tears the whole time. I don't know how to handle awkward situations, especially when its my fault, so when I went to the cooler to get more carrots, I stood in there and just cried for about five minutes.

It's important to remember that a search of your car is only permissible if the police have specific evidence that you have contraband, such as drugs or weapons, in your vehicle. Being pulled over or arrested is not blanket authority to search your entire car.

If the police do not have any specific evidence that you have contraband in your car, they cannot search it without your consent. You have the right to refuse a search of your car, and you should exercise that right.

If the police do have specific evidence that you have contraband in your car, you still have the right to refuse the search. However, the police may then get a warrant to search your car and you may be arrested for obstruction of justice if you refuse.

It's important to remember that you have the right to refuse a search of your car if the police do not have specific evidence that you have contraband in your vehicle. Knowing your rights is the best way to protect yourself in these situations.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/law with title ""A search is only permitted for specific contraband and being pulled over and/or arrested is not blanket authority to search entire car.""","First, we must distinguish b/t pc to stop, to arrest, and to search. These are separate and distinct. 

To Stop: Needs pc that **you committed the infraction** you are being stopped for.

To Arrest: This is the same as the stop (since it was for a crime) - and therefore you can be arrested for the crime. While this rarely happens - it is completely within the cop's power to do this.

To Search: This is where it changes. The cop must have pc that an ""instrumentality of the crime"" you were pulled over is in your car; OR separate PC that some other contraband is in your car, i.e. drugs. The search **must be limited** to those places that could contain the contraband. 

A few examples to help clarify.

Ex. Pulled over for speeding. Absent a gun in plain sight or smell of drugs - no permissible search may be had. (the same is true if you didn't have a license - b/c it is unreasonable to believe it is in your car since you would have found it/provided it otherwise)

Ex. Pulled over for fleeing an armed bank robbery. Now there is pc to search your car for a gun - and this would likely cover the entire car since a gun is small and can be hidden anywhere. 

Terry-search: It while being pulled over you are acting crazy and the officer reasonably fears for his safety - then he is permitted to do a cursory search of you car for **weapons only** that are within your immediate reach.

Hope this helps.

So the summer between grade 9 and 10, I took a ""Reach Ahead"" summer school course so that I only had to take it over 4 weeks instead of a whole semester. In this class was this totally awesome girl that I got partnered with for a couple projects early on. She was a wiccan and kinda goth but really fun to be around. Young devoutly catholic me fell for her head over heels, but I was a shy and nervous kid. When we were about half way through the third week we were in the computer lab for an assignment, and I kept bugging her to send me an email, even though she was sitting right next to me. I told her that it was because I didn't have her on MSN yet (which was true), and she kept saying she'd just give it to me after class. Eventually she relented and sent me an email. Not a minute later I sent her an email asking her out. I was too shy to actually say it, and she thought it was cute. 

We went out that weekend and we started spending a lot of our free time together, eventually becoming boyfriend and girlfriend. On the last day of summer school, we stayed behind after classes were done, and sat on one of the buildings and just talked and watched the empty field. We had an amazing kiss and afterward she told me she loved me. She was the first girl to ever tell me that. We kept dating in the school year, but for a couple of younger kids, going to separate schools and only seeing each other about twice a month got too hard, and around Christmas we broke up. It was kinda rough going but I got through it.

The next summer we started hanging out more and decided to get back together again. Thing were pretty good until one day when she got super mad at me for not calling her back to go to an evanescence concert. What had happened was she phoned my house and my sister picked up and took a message. One that she never passed on. Despite all that, we had a pretty big fight, and broke up again.

I had just started to get over it again when I logged into facebook one day and I see her best friends status: ""R.I.P (ex's name), I'll miss you"". I emailed her, and she told me that my ex had committed suicide, and when the funeral was. She was 16. 6 years later and I still don't know how it happened or if there was a note or anything. Just that she's gone. My parents were supportive, giving me my space, but mostly I just kind of shut down in the time between my initial breakdown and the funeral. I went and got bought a suit, I got driven to the the funeral and sat in the pew and listened to her cousin tell stories from when she was a little girl. It was actually one of the best eulogies I've ever heard. I almost managed to hold it together until they played the funeral dirge. ""My Immortal"". I just remembered the concert and the fight and I just broke down again. I spent the rest of high school getting over her, and I couldn't even listen to ""My Immortal"" until 2 years after I'd graduated.

TL:DR; Had my first love in summer school, on-off relationship for about 2 years. She committed suicide after out last breakup.

It's not being a Skinhead that makes that statement wrong, it's the fact that the statement is based on hate and bigotry. Skinheads have been associated with racism and violence, and while some may not be motivated by hatred or prejudice, the fact remains that they are often associated with those ideologies. Therefore, any statement that is based on hatred or bigotry is wrong, regardless of who is making it.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/starcraft with title ""It's not being a Skinhead, that makes that statement wrong""","Any person of at least a little fame would get an insane amount of flak for such a statement.

I had an incredibly strange dream last night. I was in a dream, and then I realized I was dreaming, so I woke up. But then I realized I was still dreaming, so I woke up again. Then I realized I was still dreaming, and I woke up a third time. It was so confusing when I actually woke up for real.

Suddenly realizing it was a dream, I forced myself awake, mortified that I had wet the bed. Luckily, I hadn't, so I went to the bathroom to really piss. But as I stood over the toilet, I realized I was yet still dreaming! I awoke to discover that the bed had been wet, and was furious with myself, only to realize I was in yet another dream--so I forced myself awake one last time, to actual reality, where the bed was dry, and pissed in the toilet.

It's no secret that the current political climate in the United States is in a state of turmoil. From the growing divide between the two major political parties, to the rise of populism, to the growing distrust of the government, it's clear that something needs to change. We need new policies that can bridge the gap between the two sides and restore trust in our government. We need policies that recognize the complexity of our society and the need for compromise. We need policies that focus on the needs of all Americans, not just those of a select few. It's time for a new direction and new policies that can bring us together, not tear us apart.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/politics with title ""Yeah, time for new policies""","Yep.  Their policies were given an excellent chance for success as a result of the Bush administration.  The results have been economic disaster and a loss of regard for the US internationally.  

People can be fooled by propaganda for a while and some people will buy a story until the day they die.  Eventually, though, the smart ones will no longer be able to deny their own experiences and observations and won't buy the bullshit from the right wing media.

Most people in the US right now have realized that this worship of ""job creators"" is utter bullshit and doesn't work for either the economy or the majority of Americans.  The public is getting tired of being nickel and dimed on stagnant wages while companies have record profits and their candidate for president is ridiculously wealthy but wants a tax break.  The ""GOP is best on national security"" has been shown to be a lie from things like the fallout of the idiocy that was the Iraq war and Obama getting Bin Laden after Bush admitted that Bin Laden wasn't a priority.  Latino voters are no longer a ""religion and we hate Cuba"" voting bloc and the immigration positions of the GOP have been almost designed to piss Latino voters off.

TLDR: Yeah, time for new policies"

Hey everyone, 

I'm 22 years old and I'm scared to be left alone in the house because of some drawers. I don't know why, but whenever I'm in the house alone, I get a weird feeling that something is in the drawers. I'm not sure what it is, but I'm scared to open them. 

Has anyone else had this experience before? If so, what did you do about it? I'd really appreciate any advice or tips on how to get over this fear. 

Thanks!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""Scared to be left alone in the house at the age of 22 because of some drawers""","When I was younger my parents went out for a meal one night, leaving me home alone for one of the first times. Now in my parents bedroom they have two huge oak chests of drawers - the really heavy kind that don't have runners on them or anything, the drawers just rest on the wood of the cabinet. These drawers are super hard to open, you have to give them a really hard tug to get them to budge and when they do they make a very distinctive noise. So anyway, I was sat downstairs watching TV on my own when all of a sudden I hear that unmistakable noise - I quickly grabbed a nearby broom and headed upstairs cautiously (believing there must have been a burglar in the house). But when I get there, nothing - one of the drawers had opened itself wide but there was no one to do so. I was thoroughly freaked out, but talked myself down that it must have been something of nothing and there must have been some simple explanation. So I go back downstairs and sit for another half an hour or so until I hear the noise again - this time I grab my coat and keys and get out of the house. I go to a friend's house nearby and stay there for a few hours until I'd talked him into coming back with me - when we go back, sure enough, a second drawer on the opposite chest had opened itself. I've never been able to explain why they both did this on that night, and as far as I'm aware they haven't done it since - but to this day, I still feel a little on edge when I'm left in the house alone.

It really bothers me when people put Int heroes into the 'support' category just because they have a high Int stat. I think Int heroes can be played in many different roles, and it's a shame when people don't give them the credit they deserve. 

I'm also really glad that you included Behe as a support hero. He has an Int stat of 5, but he can be played as an initiator, ganker, or even a semi-carry. He has a lot of utility, and I think he deserves to be played as a support.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/HeroesofNewerth with title ""It bothers me that people tend to put Ints into the 'support' category just because they're int.

A movement speed increase that can slow enemies.

Accutane is a great medication for treating acne, and it works for the vast majority of people who take it. However, there is a small percentage of people who have had adverse reactions to Accutane. I believe this may be due to the fact that Accutane is a vitamin A derivative, which can be stored in fat cells. This means that if you are overweight, you may be more likely to have a negative reaction to Accutane. While this is just my own theory, it's worth considering if you are considering taking Accutane. It's always best to consult with a doctor before starting any medication, and Accutane is no exception.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/acne with title ""Accutane is fine for 99% of people.

Most of the reasons why Accutane is banned (and it is most people are taking generics these days and don't even realize it) is because of politics and has little to nothing to do with the medication itself. Sure some people have bad reactions to it but that is how all medications are. I have spoken to a lot of my friends and relatives (6 people total) who have taken it and none of them have ever had any issues either. Also keep in mind that you don't hear about the people who are fine because they are no longer on acne websites! Overall I would not hesitate to take Accutane and am actually going to ask my doctor about taking a very low dosage of Accutane over a longer period of time (a practice common in Europe). My dermatologist actually did a lot of research with a team of other dermatologists on Accutane's effect on various organs.

TLDR: Accutane is fine for 99% of people.

It's no secret that many r/atheism posters are hypocrites who are actually part of a religion, whether they realize it or not. They may not consider themselves religious, but they often act like they are. They criticize other religions, yet they often cling to their own beliefs and try to convert others to their own views. They may not call it religion, but it's a form of faith nonetheless.

It's ironic. They come together to talk about not believing in a God. They post stories about how they 'own' theists in public or on facebook. Or how they are oppressed. 

So first off, talking about not believing in something obviously show insecurity. I'd be willing to be that half of the posters in /r/atheism are there for the karma, remove any insecurities about not believing, or they just haven't made a reddit account to unsubscribe yet. Furthermore coming together on a regular basis to talk about a lack of religion is a religion in its own sense. 

Second, who actually believes those stories on /r/atheism about people clapping when they own some theist or whatever the fuck it is. Do you know what those stories have in common with the bible? They are pretty unlikely and some people believe them and some people don't. Gosh this place seem to become more and more church like.

Third and final point. Religions have been oppressed throughout history. Suck it up deal with it. It's not like your forced to wear a jew star or anything. Give it 100 years and then your parents won't care what you believe in.

In characterization, it's insulting in the way it constantly portrays these nerds as sexist, arrogant and spineless, introverted, socially and emotionally inept (all have Mommy issues, all seem ""virginal"", all are prepubescent in behavior, all have the same fandoms, the same dislikes). I'm fine with laughing at these silly stereotypes, but no one challenges their labels, no one actually shows they are a multidimensional character in this story--they all merely follow their typical archetype. And so, there's no character development, no one changes and nothing ever happens because everyone is the same vapid and insulting stereotype.

What really disturbed me the most, however, was the lack of tact the writers took in forming Raj's character. Not only were they unable to write an inoffensive stereotype as they fall into these same ugly patterns I mentioned above... but they do it while dealing with the sensitive subject of presenting the only character who's a racial minority (assuming that Howard isn't racially or ethnically Jewish). I mean, come on. Raj's plights, his aspirations and accomplishments, are ignored even when they are clumsily introduced as center points of the plot. These writers can't seem to even write one serious episode that explores its characters, but this is much worse. It's like these writers can't even plan one episode about Raj, even to just mock and humiliate him exclusively, like they can for Sheldon or Howard or Leonard. Raj is never the center of a storyline, ever, even when he is supposed to be the joke of the episode, and therefore fails the most out of the entire character cast...which says a LOT.

""ELI5: What's the difference between a good actor and a great one?

Good actors can memorize their lines and deliver them convincingly. Great actors, on the other hand, go beyond that. They completely inhabit their character and make you believe in their performance. It's a level of dedication and commitment to their craft that sets great actors apart from good ones. 

When you watch a great actor, you don't just accept the character they're playing, you become invested in them. That's the difference between a good actor and a great one.""","give me the text of a reddit post from r/explainlikeimfive with title ""There's lots of good actors out there, but very few great ones. The difference is in how thoroughly they inhabit their character, and, in turn, how much of their performance you buy.""","This is a complicated question, but I think it basically comes down to, do you buy it? Or does it feel like this person, the actor, isn't being true to the situation emotionally? 

The more demanding the role, the harder it usually is for the actor to convince you that he is the character he's portraying, and the more accolades he deserves if he successfully pulls it off. 

One of the finest performances I've seen in recent memory is Christian Bale in The Fighter. He thoroughly inhabits that character, physically, mentally, to the point where you don't question he is anyone but the loser crack addict brother of Mark Walhberg's character. He doesn't always hit 'em out of the park, but when he does, man is he brilliant. 

Johnny Depp is also really good at this, his older, pre ""Pirates"" stuff much more so than any of his more recent work. Look at a film like Donnie Brasco; he carries that film on his back, brilliantly, because he thoroughly inhabits that character. Never a false moment from him throughout that film. 

Oh, and Cate Blanchett too; her performance as Bob Dylan in ""I'm Not There"" a few years ago was one of the best I've ever seen in a film, ever. She's probably the finest female actress working today, and probably one of the best there ever was, which is saying a lot given how many great female actresses there are/have been. 

It's a skill very, very few actors can successfully pull off, but when they do, there's nothing else like it. 

Joaquin Phoenix did it for me this year in ""The Master."" He's usually a decent actor, nothing special, but his performance in that film was nothing short of brilliant. 

TL;DR: There's lots of good actors out there, but very few great ones. The difference is in how thoroughly they inhabit their character, and, in turn, how much of their performance you buy. "

I hate you Stan. You've been a lifelong Arsenal fan and you still can't see what's wrong with the club. We've had the same problems for years and you still refuse to acknowledge them. We've had terrible management, terrible signings, and terrible tactics. We've had so many chances to turn things around and yet you still remain blindly loyal to the club. I'm sorry Stan, but I just can't take it anymore. I'm done with you and Arsenal. #WengerOut","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Gunners with title ""I hate you Stan""","I'm just going to copy and paste a response I typed up in a past thread since it's easier.

&gt; How can I think that?  Because I've seen Stan do this all before.  Stan is making a profit.  Whether he is maximizing his return on investment is another thing.  He is conservatively investing, ensuring some profit, albeit like you said not as much as he could be profiting if Arsenal were winning trophies.  That would require him to take a risk and invest more in order to receive a higher return.  But Stan doesn't do that.  He manages his portfolio conservatively.

&gt; I'm only critical because I'm American and I've seen this all before.  I'm a huge sports fanatic and follow other American sports more than soccer/football.  I've watched him take over the Colorado Rapids in 04 (whose business relationships with Arsenal eventually got Stan's foot in the door to buy them also), the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche in 2000, making marginal investments in the St. Louis Rams in 95 and gaining full control in 2010.

&gt; Growing up, the Colorado Avalanche were one of the most feared hockey teams (after moving from Quebec) constantly keeping and attracting top tier talent (who here remembers Sakic, Forseberg, Roy?).  They were always competing for Stanley Cups (equiv to the EPL Title) and often division champs.  They won the Cup twice, in '96 and '01.  Stan acquired them the season they won the Stanley Cup, but he had 0 influence on operations and players at that time, since all the foundation for winning was there already.  Since he's owned the team they've been in a gradual decline each season and now they're bottom feeders of the league, not even making it to the playoffs consistently.  They keep tinkering with youth development (sound familiar?) since it's a low cost option, but won't make the plunge to sign proven talent.

&gt; The Nuggets have always been somewhat mediocre, even when Stan bought them in 2000.  They were fortunate enough to see a rise in success around '08 after they drafted one of the premiere players in the game, Carmelo Anthony, and matching it with a veteran, previous champion, Billups.  Anthony is an all star talent, constantly playing on the US team, and is an irreplaceable talent.  So what does management and ownership do when he asks for a longterm contract and expresses his frustrations about ownership not investing in a little extra talent to help push them over the top?  They trade Anthony away ALONG with their second best player, Billups, for cheap nobody players and draft picks.  The whole NBA world was shocked.  Now the Nuggets are mediocre again, coasting by and winning enough to be relevant but with no shot of ever winning an NBA title (never even in the conversation).  They even have a genius coach, George Karl, who has been coaching since the 80s and is always getting the most out of his team, but can't compete since ownership refuses to invest.

&gt; The St. Louis Rams came together around '99 with stud talent like Warner and Faulk.  This is the year that they won the Superbowl.  Stan had little to do with the success of this team, as he was just a partial owner, but the former owner Georgia Frontiere did.  It's a similar story to the Colorado Avalanche.  He gradually invested and came to own the team, with fuller ownership being reached in 2010.  And how has this team gone over the years?  Just like the Avalanche, gradually downward, from constant contenders to laughing stocks.  This team also mimics some of the troubles the Nuggets saw in not being able to appease their star talent.  Steven Jackson has been the premiere running back/player for the St. Louis Rams for years.  Arguably one of the best running backs in the NFL for years.  So how does ownership treat him this year?  They cut his playing time and toss him to the side for literally a first year rookie, Darryl Richardson.  They can't take care of Jackson either and negotiate a contract extension, even though Jackson has pledged his loyalty to the club, even through the dark years when he carried their franchise.  Instead, Jackson, who was suppose to have a year left with the Rams, is now let go going into next season and has to find a new club.  Rams haven't made the playoffs since 2004 btw..

&gt; This is why I'm critical of Stan.  I've seen him do enough to take profit from all his clubs, but never make the big/risky moves to either attempt to win it all or maximize his profits.  He'd rather always take the sure thing then go for more.  I've watched this guy ruin every sports club he's touched (besides the Colorado Rapid winning the League Cup in 2010).  So excuse me if I'm a little fearful of what is going on with Arsenal.  I don't want to see this beautiful club meet a gradual decline over the years.

The Bush administration made deep cuts to revenue and the spending has increased faster than the revenue since then. But it's important to remember that those deep cuts to revenue were a major factor in the current budget situation. The Bush administration's cuts to revenue, combined with the economic recession, have created a budget deficit that has been difficult to overcome. So while it's true that spending has increased faster than revenue, it's important to remember that the Bush administration's deep cuts to revenue set the stage for this situation.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/politics with title ""You're right, spending increased faster than revenue.  But only if you ignore the deep cuts to revenue made under Bush.""","According to [these]( numbers from the heritage foundation (which is hardly known for a liberal bias) that is not the case.  Under Clinton, Revenue increased by an average of 6% per year while Spending increased by an average of 1%.  Under Bush, Revenue increased by an average of .4% per year while Spending increased by an average of 4%. So while you are absolutely correct that as a whole Spending has increased at a faster rate than Revenue has, that figure is skewed significantly by the fact that Revenue was slashed under Bush while Spending continued to increase.  Had the 6% increase in Revenue been adhered to under Bush, then on average Revenue would have increased 2% faster than Spending.  So while you could theoretically argue that the drastic increase in the rate of Spending under Bush was due to an unsustainable precedent set by Clinton, had Bush maintained the increase in revenue set forth by Clinton, he would have maintained the surplus that he inherited .  In fact, that surplus would, today, have grown by nearly $1.4T. And that's accounting for a $500B+ increase in spending (under Obama) that arguably would not have been necessary had the increase in revenue been maintained.  I'm not an economist so I'm more than happy to be proven wrong if I'm mistaken.

tl;dr: You're right, spending increased faster than revenue.  But only if you ignore the deep cuts to revenue made under Bush."

Inflation is a hot topic these days, and it's important to understand the difference between inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and actual inflation in assets. The government has been known to change the definition of CPI to make the numbers appear lower than they actually are, meaning that the real inflation rate is much higher. This has caused a phenomenon known as stagflation, where the costs of goods and services rise while economic growth remains stagnant. So while the official numbers may say there isn't much inflation, the reality is that it's still very much present.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/politics with title ""There IS big inflation, just not as measured by CPI (which the gov changes the definition of anyway to manufacture a lower number) but in assets 
 Stagflation bitchezz""","There is most certainly inflation, but not as measured by CPI.
When we talk about inflation we simply think of it as consumer price stuff, buying bread and milk at the shops kind of stuff.

The 10 years leading up to the GFC, the Fed increased total money supply by about 85% and CPI only rose by about 35%. There is a 50% difference here, any guesses as to where it went? Remember, money just doesn't disappear.

The housing price bubble was nothing more than inflation in the price of assets, hence the term Asset Price Inflation (API). We had the GFC because the Fed kept money supply too loose leading up to it and when you added in a few other factors, it all kinda blew up.

Anyway, that term API isn't even acknowledged by the Fed or for that matter any other reserve bank around the world.

Currently QE is leading to inflation, just not CPI (which has had it's definition changed last year to reduce, lower CPI -&gt; lower gov. payments linked to CPI) but it is turning up in API.

Bond prices are currently inflated beyond belief, as well as current stock prices, precious metals and commodities.

QE doesn't work, never worked in Japan and it never will in the US.

The current problem is a structural issue that can only be addressed by the government, not something that can be fixed with the one tool the Fed knows how to use.

If China decides to dump US bonds, the US will likely see a slight increase in gas prices, but we could also see a surge of manufacturing jobs and a devastating blow to China's economy. The US could benefit from the influx of jobs and the Chinese economy would suffer greatly. It's a risky move for China, but it could pay off in the long run.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/politics with title ""If China dumps US bonds, US gas prices go up a bit, we get more manufacturing jobs and China's economy implodes.""","China holds about 8% of all US bonds. The majority of US bonds are held by the federal government in trust funds, the federal reserve and private citizens.

The ""what if China dumped"" is a non-issue. Short term reactions would include a slightly weaker dollar, which would result in some minor pain for private citizens purchasing imports that would be difficult to replace domestically (like oil) but the weaker dollar would also drive US manufacturing since it would make the US more competitive internationally. Overall, this would translate into an inconvenience for the average American, not a tragedy.

What amuses me when I hear about this threat is the fact that China tries to keep the yuan pinned just below the dollar. So any shock that devalues the dollar will smash their economy. Let me explain: China relies heavily on iron and coal imports from Australia and Brazil to keep their factories running. If they leave the yuan below the dollar the price of those necessary imports will skyrocket and they'll be forced to eat the cost and with their severely low labor prices the additional costs will have to be rolled into their product prices, removing a huge part of their trade advantage internationally. If China unpins the Yuan from the dollar the US's desire for China's cheap goods will dry up, because they will cease to be cheap (this holds true for most of China's export markets). Without a buyer for their exports, China's economy will stall out and fail.

Xinhua is toeing the national party line in the above quote. His statement has more to do with politics than anything else. They know dumping the bonds would be cutting off their nose to spite their face, they won't do it. What China will do is talk about the size of the debt and potentially dumping the bonds as a soft political tool.

TL;DR~ If China dumps US bonds, US gas prices go up a bit, we get more manufacturing jobs and China's economy implodes."

If you're just getting into playing guitar, it can be difficult to know what gauge strings you should use. The best way to figure out your preferences is to start with standard sets and work up from there. Standard sets are typically 10-46 gauge, but you can go higher or lower depending on your playing style. Experiment with different gauges to find what works best for you – heavier strings offer more sustain, while lighter strings are easier to play. Don't be afraid to try different gauges to find what works best for you!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/7String with title ""Start from standard sets and work up from there, if needed. That's the only way to find your gauge preferences""","String gauges depend on your playing style and preferences.

Main string gauge problem is that in most of standard 7-string sets (like *10-13-17-26-36-46-56*), tension of low B string is considerably lower that tension of low E string (which is usually somewhat lower than A-string tension). 

Some people don't mind it (or have accomodated their technique to it). If you're one of them, you're lucky: you can just go to shop and get what you need.

Other people (like me) may have have problem with that, because string with low tension goes sharp when you attack it hard (or fret it a bit stronger than usual). If you're one of them (or just prefer feel of balanced tension sets) you have to order single strings (D'Addario and some others others sell them) or balanced sets (some manufacturers do them).

The best way to discover your needs is to start from standard set (10 or 9, depending on what you prefer on six-string) and then alter the gauges if you need that.

That's what I did. I like standard 10-46 sets on six-string and bought seven string, mainly to be used for metal in standard and DropA tunings.

It seemed to have some standard *10-13-17-26-36-46-56* set, and I wasn't happy with that at all. 7th string was going sharp just from me not being gentle with it. Even in B (in DropA it was even worse)! And I don't consider myself wild string-beater, I just play with fairly strong attack when needed. 

I tried *10-13-17-26-36-46-60* set. Not much difference. I still couldn't hit low B5 chord without low B string going sharp for a while.

Then I bought heavy bottom *10-13-17-30-42-54-64* set. 7th string was much better, but 5th and 6th were a bit too heavy for me.

And finally I spent some time with [tension calculator]( and ordered custom set from the same company. It was *10-13-18-26-38-50-68* and that's what I stick to now. 
It's basically standard ""10"" set, but A-string is a little thicker, low E-string is some more thicker and low B string is seriously heavier. That makes low strings tension much more balanced and, finally, 7th string is not floppy. If I used it only in B, I'd choose something lighter, like .64. But I need it to work in low A too.

I also made G-string a little thicker, firstly because I drop it to F# sometimes, secondly to even the tension in standard tuning even more.

Gay men make the best wingmen because they understand the dynamics between men and women better than anyone else. They know how to be supportive, provide a safe space to talk, and are great at giving advice. Plus, they know how to make sure everyone is having a good time and can help to break the ice in awkward situations. Whether you're looking for a laugh or a bit of encouragement, having a gay friend around can be the best wingman you could ever have.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskMen with title ""Gay men are the best wingmen you could ever have.""","I am a recent graduate and just moved to Chicago and was very happy to find out that a couple of my schoolmates moved here. Three of my best friends here are a lesbian couple and a gay man.

Keep in mind that I also went to art school, but in terms of men I've had many gay friends. They're wonderful and a great resource. It's also mutually beneficial to each other. 

For me I was able to meet some really, really attractive women through my gay friends. Pardon for using such an offensive term but I have no other way to describe it, but a lot of attractive girls are ""fag hags"", in the sense that they don't have too many lady friends so they gravitate to gay men to be their best friends. 

Being friends with that gay guy is a great in to these girls. It means that you're safe and that you can hang with both of them and have your friend vouch for you.

It also works for the gay guys as well. You need to understand that at their core gay guys are essentially the same as straight dudes when they're on the prowl. It's just that their intentions are more well known. I live near Halsted in Chicago, which is infamous for being the gay district, and I always go out and be a bro to my gay friend and wingman him whenever we go to those bars. 

It's less pay it forward and more me using myself to his advantage. Just like a regular wingman, gay guys will find someone they fancy but then might get cold feet and bitch out. I on the other hand am a neutral party and since I'm straight can easily start a conversation with the target and wingman him.

It's like when you have a friend who has a girlfriend start the conversation with a woman you want to talk to. Since you made it known that you're not a threat or a target, they ease up, which will allow you to give your friend a fair shot.

It's no secret that anxiety and depression are two of the most common mental health issues people face today. While they may share some similarities, they are also distinct in their own ways. 

Anxiety is about confronting negative expectations and realizing they are often overblown. It can be a fear of failure or a fear of the unknown. It is a feeling of apprehension and unease that can lead to physical symptoms such as sweating, trembling, and difficulty breathing. 

Depression is about confronting negative thought patterns and realizing they are unreasonable. It can be a feeling of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness. It can also lead to physical symptoms such as fatigue, loss of appetite, and difficulty concentrating. 

Both anxiety and depression can be debilitating and can have a serious impact on someone's life. It is important to recognize the differences between the two and to seek help from a mental health professional if needed.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/business with title ""Anxiety is about confronting negative expectations and realizing they are often overblown. Depression is about confronting negative thought patterns and realizing they are unreasonable.""","As a mental health counselor, I can attest that this has less to do with depression than it does anxiety. Some of the best techniques for treating anxiety are to confront those fears directly through imagined or in-vivo experiments, much like the one the author alluded to about the subway. This is called exposure therapy. Our brains, for whatever reason (evolutionary or otherwise) are predisposed to process negative information first and foremost. For example, in a group with my clients I may ask them ""what went wrong today?"" and they'd supply their answers. Then I would ask them ""what went right?"" What they don't realize is that this isn't about the content of their answers; I'm actually timing them in my mind to see how quickly they respond. 9 times out of 10 they can supply the negative much more quickly than the positive. Because we are predisposed to avoid negative outcomes, we come to avoid any situations which may lead to negative outcomes, and thus an anxiety disorder may result (agoraphobia, social anxiety, etc.). 
     Depression, on the other hand, is more about negativistic vs. realistic but hopeful thinking. As the author suggests, if we could just ""think positive"" and alleviate our depression I'd be out of a job. The problem is that overly positive thinking does not ring true for us, and so it does not take hold for us emotionally. For example, I could walk around telling myself ""I will succeed at everything I try"", but 1) as a realist I don't actually believe that, and 2) even if I did I'd be in for a rude awakening on a daily basis. The irony is that it is just as silly for me to say to myself ""I will fail at everything I try"", but not only am I more likely to believe this (as negatives such as past failures are more easily retrieved from memory as evidence), but also this syncs with my emotional state (sadness/self-loathing) and so I may then allow this thought to take hold and drag myself deeper into the spiral of depression. Both thoughts are outlandish, but the negative one is more likely to impact us, and that is a key point in terms of depression. Only through meta-cognition (thinking about our thinking) can we work to catch ourselves when we begin to think this way, and substitute realistic and hopeful alternative thoughts such as ""I will have my successes and my failures, but even in failure I can succeed by learning from my mistakes"". Counselors and therapists do not teach depressed clients to ignore all the negatives, they teach clients to acknowledge and appreciate the positives they have long been ignoring.

TL;DR - Anxiety is about confronting negative expectations and realizing they are often overblown. Depression is about confronting negative thought patterns and realizing they are unreasonable."

I had sex with my first boyfriend because I felt like if I didn't I would be a bad girlfriend.

It eventually ruined our relationship after two years. He was very patient and when I explained how I felt he said he'd rather wait than make me do something I didn't want to do. But I kept on having sex with him because I knew he wanted it; I'd even initiate because I thought it would make him happy. In the end I didn't even want him to touch me because if we were together (LDR) it seemed to lead to sex.

That was even when my partner said he would wait, never said anything like ""not being interested in a relationship that never leads to sex"". So I can only imagine what  your girlfriend is feeling right now; and what she needs is help and therapy, not more pressure.

She may one day get more comfortable. But this could be years from now, so if you aren't willing to wait that long I would recommend backing out sooner rather than later.

It's no surprise that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is often criticized for its representation of the science. While the IPCC does a good job of summarizing the existing scientific literature, the physical processes in the atmosphere are so complex that the scientific community still has a lot to learn.

Rather than presenting the science as if we have a good grasp on things, the IPCC should be emphasizing the scientific community's ignorance. This would help to avoid the impression that the science is settled, when in reality there is still much to be learned.

It's important to recognize that uncertainty is an inherent part of science, and that the IPCC should be communicating this to the public. By emphasizing the scientific community's ignorance, the IPCC can help to avoid unwarranted certainty and ensure that the public is better informed about the state of climate science.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/science with title ""We don't understand the physical processes in the atmosphere very well but IPCC represents like we have a good grasp on things.  The IPCC should emphasize the scientific community's ignorance, not its unwarranted certainty.""","Wow, could they be any more vague reporting the cosmic ray thing?  Perhaps the reason the IPCC is now more certain of AGW than they used to be is because all the dissenters have left this purely political organization that touts itself as a scientific one.

On the cosmic rays:  Greenhouse AGW says the lower atmosphere is where we should see the most warming but this is the part of the atmosphere where we see the least warming.  Instead, the heat is accumulating in the upper atmosphere most strongly.  I do not see any evidence implicating cosmic rays in the warming but this is a poorly understood area of physics.  Since cosmic rays are co-located with the strongest warming it is certainly a valid idea that deserves attention.  Personally, I think the upper atmosphere warming could be attributed to Mach's principle which has to do with the aether.  Scientists are ""99% sure there is no aether"" but there is strong evidence that the aether exists.

But I digest... we do not know anything about the aether.  What we do know a little about is [lightning and red sprites and blue jets]( (at least we know for sure these things exist.)  These three things -- lightning, sprites and jets -- are atmospheric phenomena that we do not understand; however, the IPCC ignores this ignorance.  Instead, they represent that physical processes in the atmosphere are well understood.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  

Firstly, there is no known physical model that can explain the large scale accumulation of charge that leads to lightning.  Then in the upper atmosphere above lightning (where the strongest warming is seen) we have these sprites and jets that move faster than 10% of the speed of light.  Why are there crazy relativistic effects associated with lightning?  We can't even begin to address that since we haven't been able to come with a model for atmospheric lightning.  Then beyond the mystery of lightning, we have the deeper mystery of jets and sprites occurring in the same part of the atmosphere as the strongest warming.  Indeed, red sprites live in the thermosphere so it is not far fetched that this process is related to temperature.

**TL;DR** We don't understand the physical processes in the atmosphere very well but IPCC represents like we have a good grasp on things.  The IPCC should emphasize the scientific community's ignorance, not its unwarranted certainty."

I recently switched from Sam's Club to Costco and I'm so glad I did! Costco has lower prices on so many items and the selection is much better. Plus, I love the convenience of having a Costco near me. 

I also love how Costco has a laundry, snack stash, and chore sheet/chore days. This makes it so much easier to keep track of what needs to be done and how much money I'm spending. Plus, the insurance and clinic make it so much easier to get the medical care I need.

Not to mention Sam's Club is a part of Walmart (I think) so if you have reasons not to shop at that hell hole, I would for serious recommend Costco.

Also, learn how to do laundry if you don't.  Learn how to remove stains, etc.  Especially important if  you are a lady, dear reader.  If you are going to have room mates, keep a snack stash in your room of non-perishable snacky things that they can't eat.  

Also, someone mentioned a chore sheet, but if you're living alone my advice is to set up a cleaning schedule (and maybe this would work with roomies?) I've been meaning to set this up, but what you do is clean a little bit each day.  Like, dust Monday, wipe down bathrooms Tuesday, vacuum Wednesday, mop Thursday, etc etc.  That or do everything on one day, like Saturday morning.

Also!  If you have insurance (through your parents or otherwise) carry the card on you, or at least a copy of it.  I'm a sickly child (or I was) so having that up at college was very useful.  If you are going to college, definitely find out about your clinic situation.  My campus' clinic offers free (FREE) health screenings and the like.  These things usually can run up to $200 (they do full blood work up, general check up, STD, pregnancy tests, birth control).

Also, depending on your age and your insurance situation, you might need to get a GP to take care of more serious things.

We often hear people talking about work that is “beneath” them, or that they would never do. But the truth is, there is no job that is beneath someone. Any job that helps you cover your costs and doesn’t hurt others should be embraced and taken seriously.

No matter what type of job you take, you should always strive to do your best and take pride in your work. You never know what opportunities might arise from it, and it’s always better to have a good work ethic than to be seen as someone who only does the bare minimum.

This post is about the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) and their recent legal battles.

I'm sure many of you are familiar with the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) and their controversial views. Recently, they've been in the news for a variety of reasons, but most notably for their lawsuits and countersuits against various organizations and individuals.

However, it seems that the WBC is more interested in lawsuits and countersuits than in their original mission of protesting funerals, rallies, and other events. It's disheartening to see an organization that was originally founded to spread a message of hate become more focused on legal battles than on their original purpose.

What do you think about the WBC's recent legal activities? Do you think they're wasting their time and resources on lawsuits and countersuits, or do you think it's a necessary part of their mission? Let us know in the comments!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/pics with title ""WBC is more interested in suits/countersuits/profile than fags.""","This is perhaps misguided because of a vulnerable presumption.

The WBC motivation is not exclusively discriminatory, they're also litigious assholes.  Part of the schtick is provoking a response so they can sue.

So, giving $1000 to whatever gay cause isn't exactly a bad thing, it may not cause the WBC to shy away.  

tl;dr:  WBC is more interested in suits/countersuits/profile than fags.

Just like a Texas license plate on a car doesn't guarantee that it hasn't ever been to California. It's possible that the uniform has been used, but just not with the patch.

The soldier simply said he wore the uniform in Vietnam. As most people know, when you change duty stations, you remove your old patches and add the new ones from your new assignment. It is very possible that the soldier served in both Vietnam and later on the DMZ in South Korea. It is very likely that the uniform could have been worn in Vietnam. To actually disprove the claim that the uniform was worn in Vietnam, you have to prove somehow that the uniform wasn't made until after the conflict, if that is possible. Simply looking at the patches tells us nothing other then where else the uniform has likely been.

As a society, we have to draw a line somewhere when it comes to gun rights. We don't treat any rights as absolute, and we have already drawn an arbitrary line in the sand with guns. We need to make it harder for crazies to get their hands on guns and use them to kill innocent little kids. We need to take a hard look at our gun laws and make sure they are doing what they can to keep our kids safe.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AdviceAnimals with title ""We dont treat any rights as absolute, and already draw an arbitrary line in the sand with guns.  Let's make it harder for crazies to kill little kids.""","When that amendment was written, the arms that they were talking about legitimately empowered citizens to stand up against governments.  Groups of armed citizens could pose a legitimate existential threat to a rouge government.

That simply isnt true now.  If [theoretical situation] the US government went rogue, started oppressing its people, you'd be hardly better off with the guns that we do allow than with a knife and some rocks to throw--the military's capabilities have simply outstretched where handheld firearms can really keep them in check.

And you dont infringe on my rights, but the government does all the time, in ways that I think are justified and good.  Look at free speech--yes I have the right to speak, unless the words that I say cause harm to other people in a concrete way.  I cannot incite specific violence, I cannot speek with the intention of causing panic, etc.  None of that is mentioned in the first amendment--it is the result of reasonable people applying a philosophical and abstract 'right' to a concrete and complicated world.  Rights are not absolute--in many cases we are balancing rights and interests, and based on the ramifications of different policies have to decide on the best way to do so.

My overarching point is that very few people believe that there should be no regulations on who can own what kind of gun--nobody thinks I should be able to keep a nuke and a tank in my back yard.  So we are already drawing somewhat arbitrary lines: this is OK, this isnt.  We have already admitted that the right is not absolute.  And I dont think that there is inherently anything magical about where the line is drawn right now--read up on the history of how it came to be, all the political infighting etc over many decades and I think you'll have to agree.  With that in mind, it seems entirely reasonable to ask the question of where that line would ideally be drawn.  And I think that given the violent proclivities of some of our citizens, making it harder to get at weapons can only be a good thing.

Something I should clarify too--a lot of people respond to the above by saying 'oh but they're nuts, they're still going to try to kill people.'  I agree with that--I dont think we'll actually be able to reduce the number of attacks.  But with incidents like Sandy Hook, Columbine, etc, it seems like these guys go on killing people at a certain rate until the cops show up and either plug them or force them to plug themselves.  I think the response rate is probably pretty constant.  So if we can reduce the rate at which they can kill people, we'll save lives.  The school stabbing in china is a great example of this--yes, the guy didnt have a gun and still attacked.  But nobody is dead.  Can you tell me that would be the case if he had had an AK instead of a Bowie?

TL;DR: 

We dont treat any rights as absolute, and already draw an arbitrary line in the sand with guns.  Let's make it harder for crazies to kill little kids."

We have too many guns in the US to make a flat-out gun ban work. That's why we need to demand greater responsibility from gun owners. We need to make sure that guns are kept secure and that only responsible people have access to them. We need to make sure that those who own firearms are educated on gun safety and know the laws regarding gun ownership and use. We need to push for better background checks, and for better mental health resources to help those who may be at risk of violence. We need to work together to make sure that guns are used responsibly and safely.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AdviceAnimals with title ""We have too many guns in the US to make a flat-out gun ban work. Demand greater responsibility from owners.""","Here's why gun control won't work.

First of all, I love guns. They're fun to shoot. However, if we could rid society 100% of guns, I would definitely be in support of it. 

But there lies the problem in American society. You will never come CLOSE to achieving 100% gun prohibition. I know it's impossible even for the strictest of countries, but in the USA, a complete ban will result in a lot of ""secret"" guns being owned. 

- We have lived in a gun culture since day 1. Fuck - Our CONSTITUTION  defines rules about gun ownership. Now, I believe that the original individual rights were pro-gun because of the general lawlessness that was feared in a post-colonial America, in addition to being able to defend against repeated attacks from Britain. 

- 236 years of Gun ownership means that there exists historically many legally-owned unregistered firearms, many of which still work, or can be reconditioned to work. If you outlaw firearms, then most of these will exist. 

- ""If you outlaw guns, then only outlaws will own them."" I only half agree with this; many outlaws simply steal guns from law-abiding citizens - therefore, if you banned guns, they wouldn't get them. HOWEVER, the US has a massive balance of trade problem (we import way too much), and as a result, more containers come to port than we can scan. Criminals are crafty - they operate where there is need in the market - that need will be illegal firearm importing. 

- You will eliminate any chance of people being able to defend themselves against a government that decides to eliminate its constitutional limitations. I know this probably is unlikely, and therefore unimportant, but historically, there have been events that could have been prevented with private citizen gun ownership. Some argue that parts of WWII and similar ethnic cleansing tragedies could have been prevented this way. 

- Police simply won't step in. Police are better investigators than anything - they simply don't stop murders, and crimes from happening. They collect evidence and arrest after the fact. People say that our public safety officers will protect us, but I don't feel so confident. 

***

If we ban firearms, law-abiding citizens won't stand a chance. The number of guns existing illegally would be incredibly high - higher than in any other country that banned guns. 

Unless someone can come up with a better plan to rid the country of firearms, I propose a plan that will be unpopular among legal firearm owners, but it will definitely address the problem. 

Demand greater responsibility from firearms owners. If someone steals your gun and uses it in a murder, you share the blame even more so than what's being demanded today. I realize that this is irrelevant in last week's massacre (the gun owner was murdered herself), but it WOULD fix a lot of the problem. After a few high profile cases, you can bet that everyone who wants to keep their firearms will invest in a safe of some sort.

tl;dr - We have too many guns in the US to make a flat-out gun ban work. Demand greater responsibility from owners. "

I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who think that higher refresh rates are more important than higher resolutions when it comes to gaming. But, IMO, higher resolutions are always going to be more important than higher refresh rates. Sure, higher refresh rates can make your games look smoother, but a higher resolution will give you a better overall experience, as you'll be able to see more of the game world. Plus, with higher resolutions, you'll be able to get better performance out of your graphics card, as it won't have to render as many pixels. So, higher resolution > higher refresh rate any day of the week, in my opinion. Edit: Words are hard.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/buildapc with title ""IMO, Higher Res > Higher Refresh any day of the week 
 Edit: words are hard""","In colorful games (WoW, Trine, etc) I can tell a difference in the vibrancy, but IPS was not the reason I got the monitor. 2560x1600 is really the kicker, and I would say it most assuredly beats out the ever-so-slight improvement I could see with 120Hz over 60Hz.

I realize not everyone's eyeballs are the same, and it could be that mine are too weathered to notice it, but I think a lot of the 120Hz support is self-affirmation of people who are looking to project their purchase decision on others. In the heat of the game, it's just not that noticeable. It does really depends on the type of games you play, as well, though. I don't frequently play shooters, but even when I do, the difference between 60Hz and 120Hz in say, Battlefield 3, is really only apparent to me when I'm spinning my character around in circles, and even then, its a marginal effect. In contrast, the 2560x1600 res is incredibly noticeable, as you have *double* the number of pixels being displayed compared to 1920x1080 (2,073,600 vs 4,096,000). For comparison, go boot a game at 1366x768 (1,049,000 pixels) and compare it to 1920x1080. That's the fidelity difference I'm talking about.

I also decided to go so heavy into the monitor because I knew that it would last me through several builds, or at least until 4K displays become economical, which won't be for several years.

I liked his inclusion of the quote: ""but there were a lot of hidden story elements that some players may not have caught before, and I’m hoping to make some of that a little bit more clear or directly expressed."" I personally love the tinfoil-hat levels of depth in fan speculation around this game a la Gwyn's Firstborn, Serpent Affiliation, etc. but we can take the Dark Lord path as a really good example of taking obfuscation too far.

Talking to Kaathe reveals everything about the fourth Lord Soul, and uncovers the falsehoods of the ""Link the Fire"" ending and the fear of the Lords. Like, that is a huge story element, and totally sheds awesome new light on the game. Now. How many people are going to find that out on their own, without a guide? You need to sequence-break the game pretty damn hard, for seemingly zero purpose, and with about zero foreshadowing. Sure, ingward mentions the four Kings falling to Dark, but there's nothing to really lead you to believe that there's any reason to beat the Four Kings before talking to Frampt.

For one of the smaller things, totally keep it hush hush. Ash Lake is completely awesome while not really contributing anything critical to the plot besides that Dragons still exist. Which has potential for the future, but doesn't change the immediate plot that much, and even Domhall gives a hint about that. 

I'm just saying that something that big, that important, that illuminating to the main plot, something that could add so much more satisfaction to the player's understanding of the story, is going to be missed by such a huge percentage of the player base. And while you can look it up in guides, wouldn't it be that little bit more satisfying to have had a fair chance to figure it out for yourself?

I think it is the coolest thing that something that huge could be hidden, like a great big secret that changes everything. I can't imagine how amazed I'd be if I stumbled across it on a 4th playthrough, and how that would change everything for me. But I can't see any reason I'd ever stumble across it naturally, and that's a damn shame that as cool as that might be for me, another 9 people might never get to know.

Hey everyone, 

I'm a big fan of Dota 2 and I've been watching some of the professional teams play recently. One thing I've noticed is that they push really hard on towers. No matter how much Tree tries to defend, they just keep pushing and eventually take the towers down. 

I'm wondering if this is a common strategy among pro teams or if it's just a fluke. Does anyone have any insight on this? Are there any strategies that Tree can use to better defend against these pushes? 

Thanks in advance for any advice!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/DotA2 with title ""Pro teams push really hard on towers, Tree can't stop that.""","I completely agree with you that Tree is underutilized.

Think about pro games you watch. T1s are often given up fairly easily and we accept that these will likely go down without an extreme fight most of the time. The T2 and T3 towers are what matter most, and often the pushes against those towers are 5 man unrelenting pushes. They aren't the kill half the health and leave pushes that happen more in pub games. They take the entire tower and Tree wouldn't be able to save them.

It's been an uphill climb to get where I am, and I've had to do a lot of navigating in a system I really don't understand and I don't have anyone to explain to me. But I really like where I'm at now, I like my teachers and my class mates, and the place where I live now. 

And above all, I **love** living in Denmark. I wouldn't trade living here for anywhere else in the world. I love the slower pace of life, and the hygge and the pølsevognen and the pebernødder and even the grinning old lady who insisted that it was TVENTY KRONERZ when I got a cola Christmas shopping this week (I guess she heard my accent).

I love that I ran into my mother in law shopping yesterday and she bought us a bag of chips and drove me home. I love that I walked to the store in the first place and it was completely dark at 4pm and I ran into our regular checkout girl and she smiled at me. I love that my best friend from school and her husband came over tonight and we made plans for midsummer and it's not even Christmas.

This place feels exactly like we're raised to believe small town America should be and it's *not even in the same hemisphere*. In the morning kids ride their bikes to school and there's a playground outside my garden and I have a garden (How cool is that?)! 

**tl;dr** Denmark has its ups and downs, but it's an amazing place to live. "

Hey everyone,

I just got married a few months ago and I wanted to share some advice for anyone planning their own wedding. One thing I did that was really unique and fun was to have my kids play some cool music at the reception.

My kids are all grown up now, but I wanted to make sure they had a special role in our wedding. We had them play some of their favorite songs from their childhood, as well as some of our favorite songs. It was a great way to involve our kids and add a personal touch to the celebration.

If you're looking for a way to make your wedding even more special, I highly suggest having your kids play some cool music. It will make the day even more memorable and add a unique touch of fun.

Happy planning!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/videos with title ""Kids, play cool music at your wedding.""","Our wedding DJ played the real Enter Sandman at our reception (by request) as we got introduced to the guests as a couple. Then again, we played all cool music, including my wife walking down the isle to the Beatles wearing rhinestone Doc Martens.

Over the years, most of our guests have commented that our wedding has been the best wedding they ever attended. TL;DR: Kids, play cool music at your wedding."

It's great to see a LEO acting with such professionalism and compassion.

My suggestion would be to encourage the woman to seek counseling and other forms of support from a qualified professional to help her through this difficult time.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/ProtectAndServe with title ""LEO true professional, woman sounds like something bad happened to her- maybe seek counseling?""","*says she gets paid less than minimum wage*

Today I learned that fame is a sexually transmitted disease and she's got a bad case of it. It's incredibly contagious and can spread like wildfire. It seems that the more famous someone becomes, the more people want to be around them and the more their fame grows. It's a vicious cycle that can be hard to break. The only real cure is to take a step back from the spotlight and try to live a more normal life.

Making sure your resume is concise and focused is key to standing out from the crowd.

As an astrophysicist, I'm curious about the rate at which our Sun burns compared to the massive stars that produce supernovae. It's clear that our Sun is much slower in burning its fuel than these stars, yet it is believed that these supernovae played a major role in creating the heavy elements in our solar system. Can anyone explain why this is the case, or provide any insight into how supernovae could have created the heavy elements in our solar system?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/askscience with title ""Our Sun burns quite slowly compared to the massive stars that actually produce supernovae. Chances are there are quite a lot of supernovae that went into creating the heavy elements in our solar system.""","So, a few things to keep in mind here that may or may not be confusing you:

1) Our Sun is somewhere in the middle-to-smallish range of stellar masses. Stars come anywhere from about 120 times more massive, to about 12 times less massive.

2) Just like celebrities, the bigger the star, the faster it burns out. (Lindsey Lohan: burned out quickly. Foghat: still probably touring somewhere in Des Moines.) True, our Sun will last somewhere in the ~10 billion year range, but the very massive stars may only last about 1 million years - i.e. 10,000 times shorter lifespan than our Sun. There's plenty of time for lots of those to have occurred over the age of our universe.

3) Only large stars (about 5 times the mass of our Sun) end in the explosive Type II supernovae and seed a wide portion of the rest of the galaxy with heavy elements. Smaller than that, our Sun included, and stars will end as planetary nebulae, quietly shedding only their outer hydrogen layers to the small local neighborhood.

4) It's only in supernovae that the really heavy elements are produced. Beyond iron, fusion becomes endothermic (it requires energy to produce heavier elements instead of releasing energy), meaning that you need a huge release of energy to make those reactions occur.

With all that said, there are a few other stellar life-cycle considerations here. Really massive stars that go supernova in only a few million years haven't had time to leave the stellar nursery. In fact, this event - the first supernova from the most massive star in the group - is usually what cuts short the production of new stars in star-forming regions.

Moreover, there's good evidence that the first supernova can often trigger more supernovae from stars in the region. The combined effect of multiple supernovae can produce a ""galactic fountain"", producing enough of an over-pressure to pop these heavy elements out of the plane of the galaxy, and subsequently raining this material down over a very wide area.

Whether the bulk of the heavier material in our own solar system came from just one such event or multiple fountains isn't terribly well known. The fact that our Sun is unusually metal-rich (as are most stars which support planetary systems) may indicate multiple such events.

**TL;DR**: Our Sun burns quite slowly compared to the massive stars that actually produce supernovae. Chances are there are quite a lot of supernovae that went into creating the heavy elements in our solar system."

ELI5: Even if it doesn't map directly to physical space, sometimes abstract concepts are useful in truly unexpected places. 

Abstract concepts are ideas that don't have a physical representation. For example, the concept of love isn't something you can touch or see, but it's still an important part of our lives. 

Abstract concepts can be useful in unexpected places, like when scientists are trying to understand how certain things work. For example, when scientists were trying to figure out why some particles behave differently than others, they used the concept of energy. Energy is an abstract concept, but it helped them understand why particles behave the way they do. 

Abstract concepts can also be useful when making decisions. For example, when deciding which job to take, you might consider the concept of job satisfaction. Job satisfaction is an abstract concept, but it can help you decide which job is best for you. 

So even though abstract concepts don't have a physical representation, they can still be useful in unexpected places.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/explainlikeimfive with title ""Even if it doesn't map directly to physical space, sometimes abstract concepts are useful in truly unexpected places.""","&gt; But is there any reason to think such a dimension exists?

Quite a few years ago, I was given a task at work. The task was to take the textures for [our game under development]( and make them smaller. See, the way things were going, we'd need two DVDs to store the entire game . . . and gamers *hate* that . . . so either we needed to cut a large chunk of the game, reduce our texture quality considerably, or crunch the textures down by a lot.

The end solution ended up being best described as ""horrifyingly complicated"", and I'm not going to describe it in detail here (unless someone really wants, I suppose.) But part of it involved treating 2x2 texel chunks as points in a 16-dimensional colorspace, then doing various processes on that point cloud.

In the end, I managed to compress the textures enough that we didn't have to compromise on either game length or texture quality.

It's a common misconception that GHz is the most important factor when it comes to choosing a processor. While it's true that higher GHz means higher performance, it's not the only factor to consider.

When it comes to choosing a processor, benchmarks are the best way to measure performance. Benchmarks measure how well a processor performs in various tasks, such as gaming, video editing, and more. This allows you to compare processors of different GHz and make an informed decision about which one is best for your needs.

So remember, when it comes to choosing a processor, GHz means nothing. Benchmarks means everything.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/buildapc with title ""GHz means nothing. Benchmarks means everything.""","The clock speed is only comparable within the same processor model.

**TIFU by combining magnets with my urethra [NSFW]**

I am the luckiest dumbass ever to live. So I had the weekend at home to myself. My flatmate had gone away, a little me-time was scheduled. 

Now, I like to experiment. I'd heard about sounding (sticking things into the urethra) and thought I'd give it a go. Initial experiments were unsuccessful- chopsticks were a little large for my virgin pee-hole. No big deal, I'm sure I can find something else.

Now, a little history. Do you know what Buckyballs are? They are a type of office toy, really popular a couple of years back. They are small, spherical, strong magnets. Pretty neat, they can be combined into all sorts of cool shapes. Also, they form into a lovely string.

Can you see where this is going?

Well, wouldn't you know it, a string of buckyballs slides up the urethra just perfectly. Like it was made for it. It's a beautiful thing. I pass away a happy afternoon plumbing the depths; these things can go a long way! And the further they go, believe me, the better it feels.
Readers. Readers who have owned Buckyballs. Do you see my error? Do you see how this delicate chain of balls, so exquisitely suited to its purpose, holds my doom?

So, evening rolls around. I decide on one last plunge. This cop is a day from retirement. This space miner has discovered a nest of funny-looking eggs. This hitchhiker is rolling up to the Bates Motel. And this is one last plunge. In they go. Ten, twenty, thirty beads. More. Forty? Fifty? I don't count. I don't care. It feels good.

I feel at this point I must explain a little more about buckyballs. I have described them as a chain; this is not so. Each ball is separate, only held to the next by its magnetism. And what do magnets love to do? They love to stick together. Remember this. I did not.

My last plunge, my final dive continues. Soon, better than half a metre of magnets is inside me. I am through the prostate, through the sphincter, in the bladder. I push on. I hit the top of the bladder. I am possessed. I push on. The buckyballs, the magnets, start to bend and curve back towards themselves. Still, I push on.

-click-

I hear a sound from deep within me.

The sound of two magnets meeting and mating.

Suddenly my beautiful chain of balls is a tangled magnetized lump. In my bladder.

This is the worst possible thing.

But now I have lengthened my tale overlong. Panic stations were activated, rationality and sobrerity returned, and I started to pull. Gently, oh so gently I pulled. This chain, this thin chain of balls was still held together only by magnetism and hope, and now there was resistance. At any moment the chain could break, would break, was certain to break. 

And if it did, there would be no hope. Nothing short of surgery would remove them.

Still the chain held. All the way down, right down to the penis. Did you know, the smallest diameter part of the whole system is the end of the penis? I do. Oh, I do. It stuck. A magnetic lump of steel, a centimetre wide, stuck an inch from freedom. Locked behind my penile gates. The chain broke. Many times, the chain broke. But the blockage was so close to the end that, with care, it could be reattached. Only to break again.

Of note here is the pinching. I hope you do not know the pain of a thin layer of penile skin being pinched repeatedly between two powerful magnets. There was blood. Even now it throbs.
The end, however, was in sight. The magnet clump was out of the danger zone, the operation zone; it was in my penis. I could control it. I could win. And, with the help of a knife and a ballpoint pen lid, I did.

TL;DR: I'm not sure I'd advise sticking 74 magnets up your dick."

I kept running, and pulling down leaves, in hopes that I'd trip up the beast. I could feel it getting closer, and I found myself being overcome by waves of nausea as its rancid breath washed over me. I shrieked, as my leg caught on a vine and I went sprawling across the jungle floor, the beast's breath filling my lungs and making me cough and choke... 

And then I woke up, still coughing, and realized that I'd pulled all of my blankets over my head, trapping in a night's worth of half-digested milkfarts. The smell was so powerful that I barfed in my mouth, splattering specks of puke willy-nilly as I wrestled my way out of the stanky blankies.

I was helping a customer look for something in the grocery store I work at, and the item wasn't on the shelf. It was a certain brand of frozen ravioli that we sell. I told her I'd go in to the walk-in freezer and take a look around. So far, fairly normal. No problem.

I go to the walk-in, open it up and go inside. I look around and don't see any boxes with that company's logo. Then I see the big, metal wheeled carts that we stack the bags of ice and other frozen products on. They're bare metal, and about 6' tall.

Well, in another moment of my infinite genius, my brain decides ""*Let's not just wonder... let's find out!

She got in the students' faces and continued to curse and scream at them, after which she began bawling. When the students awkwardly blew her off and proceeded to get on the bus, she went over to the bus driver's window and repeated *YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!* I guess she was hoping that he'd kick one of the bikes off in order to include her own. However, he too blew her off. After she realized she wasn't going to get her way, she hopped on her bike and rode to the next bus stop. When everyone on the bus realized what she was doing, we all began to jokingly warn the students not to get off. Sure enough, we saw her at the next stop. When she saw that the bikes were still on the rack, she began yelling and cursing *again*. Except this time, she flipped off the bus driver as well as the students. We were all afraid she was going to hop on the bus and kick their asses lol. Luckily, the bus driver drove off before that could happen.

TL;DR Crazy bitch at the bus stop almost kills fellow students due to not having enough bike racks on the bus."

If you're just starting out in League of Legends, it can be hard to know which champion to pick. If you want to play aggressively and get kills early on, then Caitlyn is a great choice. She has a long range and high damage output, making her great for getting the early advantage. On the other hand, if you want to play a bit more passively and farm up, then Vayne is a great option. She has a lot of mobility and can easily avoid ganks, while also having decent damage output. So if you're just starting out, it can be helpful to know which champion to pick depending on your playstyle.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/leagueoflegends with title ""If you want to play aggro early on get Caitlyn, if you want to play passive and farm play vayne.""","When i began maining ADCs i played vayne, because when you've mastered here, shes more rewarding then any ADC. The only thing that you should keep in mind is that Vayne is bad in all-in situtations if she doesnt have ult (Pre 6). You can do amazing plays with her (1 sec invis op in TFs), also she is a ""hypercarry"" (Means that she will carry way better then most carrys, because of her absurd damage.)

Cait however is quite the opposite.
She is really good early game because of her long range (650, most ranged ADs have 550) therefor its easy to snowball early on. However i believe she has the lowest damage lategame, someone calculated that.

TL;DR : If you want to play aggro early on get Caitlyn, if you want to play passive and farm play vayne."

I recently reconnected with an old acquaintance of mine after not seeing him in years. He seemed to be doing well, so I thought nothing of it. 

However, a few days ago, he randomly showed up at my house and my work uninvited and unannounced. He was clearly distressed, and I was worried about him. He kept talking about how he was feeling lost and alone, and I was afraid he might hurt himself. 

I couldn't just tell him to leave and didn't want to make him feel worse, so I tried to talk to him and be there for him. I eventually managed to get him to leave, but I'm still worried about him. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar? What did you do in this situation?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""Acquaintance I reconnected with randomly showed up at my house and my work uninvited and unannounced, and I couldn't shake him off because I was afraid he might kill himself.""","Yep. First off, I'm female. About 8 years ago, when I was 12, I used to go to a church youth group (it was one of those ""my parents made me"" things). There was a guy there who was pretty nice, whom I'd talk to occasionally just to be nice. Then I stopped to church.

Fast forward 6 years. I went to church again once for a church event celebrating anniversaries of various church-goer couples, including my parents for their 20th anniversary. I see this guy there. We chat a bit just to be nice, then I reluctantly exchange phone numbers with him just to catch up.

Now I had been dating my boyfriend for about a year and a half at this point, when stalker guy confesses his love to me (""I've been in love with you for the past 6 years"", ""You are my only friend who actually talks to me""). Oh dear. I was just talking to him to be nice. Just through texting, he had learned where I live, where I work, etc. 

Then he starts randomly showing up at my house uninvited and unannounced. Once on my birthday when I was just having a little homemade dinner party with my boyfriend and my two room mates, to give me a present (a painting of my pet bird he had painted himself).

Once he showed up randomly at my work. Apparently he had come in twice before to look for me, but I wasn't working those days. So he just decided to keep coming into my work until I was there. 

I've told him many times that I had no intention of dating him or anything, and I eventually got engaged to my boyfriend (about a year later), after which he *still *didn't get the point. I didn't want to be too harsh with this guy because he has some major depression problems and didn't want to harm him in any way. Eventually it just got way too much for me and I firmly ended all contact with him. I'm not sure is he was okay after that.

He was the most popular guy at school and I just assumed he was asking me on a fake date to be a dick (I am super socially awkward, he is not). He was not. He did not take my rejection very well.

What did he do?: He would follow me home in his car (I walked home) for about 3 years, he told the entire school that I was his girlfriend (he had an actual girlfriend, too, of whom he did not refer to as his girlfriend), and he would just ogle at me whenever he saw me, but wouldn't really speak to me. Oh, and he would pick fights out of nowhere with my boyfriend and escalate them to the point of getting both himself and my boyfriend sent to the principal's office.

He still contacts me from time to time, but always acts like it was an accident. He asked me out when I was a sophomore in high school. I am now a senior in college. I think he may have some problems.

I never stuck my D in crazy, she becomes obsessed over the fact, stalks me for about 8 years.

It all started with a simple one night stand. We had a great time and I thought that was the end of it. Little did I know, she became obsessed with me and started stalking me. She would show up at my house unannounced, call me constantly, and send me gifts. I tried to be nice and let her down gently, but she just wouldn't take no for an answer.

It got to the point where I had to get a restraining order against her. Even after that, she would find ways to contact me. It was a nightmare that lasted for 8 years. I'm glad it's finally over, but I still feel a little uneasy when I think about it. Has anyone else gone through a similar experience?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""I never stuck my D in crazy, she becomes obsessed over the fact, stalks me for about 8 years.""","My story starts in the 7th grade.  First serious girlfriend, we were together for over a year and spent a lot of time with each other's families, who we each got along with great.

Sometime in the 8th grade she calls me saying that she was rapped.  I tell her to tell her parents, or call the police... something.  She doesn't want to, just wants to be left alone for a while.  I go to confront the guy after figuring out who he is.  Guess what?  She is with him.  The rape was a lie, she turns out to be a slut.

Whatever, I am young and can move on.  She however, can't and spent the next school year trying to explain to me what had happened.  Apparently she was horny the whole time we were dating, I never made a major sexual advancement towards her, so she got the D elsewhere.  We did the normal fooling around, but at 14 I wasn't even thinking about taking things to the next level.

She spent the rest of our high school years trying to get back with me, while I did everything could to avoid her.  I still think she was obsessed over me because I was persistent in ignoring her efforts. 

Fast forward a couple years... I am a manager at a local pizza restaurant.  She is married with a small child now and is in desperate need of a job.  Despite my better judgement I get her a job.  This is where the craziness starts.

Shortly after getting hired it is clear that she is still obsessed.  She finds out where I live, keeps coming by.  I keep rejecting her.  This goes on for months until I finally give in and go for a ride with her (she no longer works for me at this point).  Things get heated, her hand ends up down my pants.  I freak out, tell her we can't do this she has a family.   She starts crying, I get out of the car and walk home quickly.

I move shortly after, and she finds out again where I live.  She keeps showing up, knocking at he door, looking in the windows and I hide.  I remember one time I was hiding under the dining room table, and she saw me through the sliding glass window from the other side of the apartment.  I don't see or hear from her for years...

The stalking finally stopped.  The last time I had a conversation with her was 7 years ago.  My first son was just born and my wife and I were leaving walmart when she walks up to us, looks at me and says ""Is  he your son?""  ""Yes"".  She drops her head and walks away.

Claimed to be pregnant with my partner's baby, then upped it to twins, then 'miscarried' when she should have started showing, then told my boyfriend's mother that I had murdered her babies with an STI she had gotten from me through him.

Waited for me outside of my workplace. Called my boss repeatedly asking if I was working. 

Rang my parents' doorbell at 2am, and spoke to my mother, after having discovered their address by illegally accessing their medical records (she is a nurse).

Forced us to change my partner's phone number innumerable times, after having pretended to be everyone from one of my coworkers whom I was apparently sleeping with to our gym to our bank.

Threatened to stop my partner's immigration papers with rape accusations.

Driven past our home innumerable times.

Contacted all of my partner's friends (including the ones living in Latin America and told them he's a lying, cheating asshole (he left her for cheating on him, repeatedly).

Actually flew to Latin America to, and I quote ""tell your friends what you REALLY are"". 

Tried to take us to small claims court for money he does not now, nor has ever, owed her. 

Contacted both of us repeatedly through aliases, calling me a slut, a whore, and a homewrecker (we got together long after he left her).

Threatened to hurt me. I'm more worried that she'll burn down my house.

Follows us to where we social dance and watches us while drinking heavily with her friends, leaving her two young daughters home alone. 

Her stalking of her ex husband is worse. She has almost gotten his fired, thrown herself repeatedly against the doors of his new home  (they have video of this) in front of their daughter, told their daughter he cheated on her with his whore new wife (actually, she cheated on him, repeatedly), and told him she is dying of cancer. 

In short, yeah. My partner is pretty broken because of her( and has lost most of his friends) and we're working on fixing the damage, but it's a long road, especially given that every time we think it's over, it's not. I'm tired and scared and frankly, sometimes I wish I could just leave, but I can't justify leaving a man whose biggest faults are obviously the direct result of years of emotional abuse and blackmail.

It's been over twenty years since the release of the original Pokemon Red and Blue versions. Despite being one of the most beloved gaming franchises of all time, the first two games weren't perfect. In particular, the HM system was often criticized for being overly tedious and restrictive.

Today I learned that birds are actually dinosaurs and, as such, are reptiles. However, mammals are not reptiles. This means that birds are the only living dinosaurs that we know of!

Birds, on the other hand, evolved from within the dinosaurs, and are more closely related to, say, Tyrannosaurus than they are to Stegosaurus. Therefore, they should be considered dinosaurs if we follow cladistics. Dinosaurs, including birds, are reptiles, because they are more closely related to crocadilians than they are to lizards and their kin. No one knows where turtles fit into it--that's actually a matter of scientific debate.

Once you do that dating crazy bitches that are bad for you is solely your fault. At the workplace politics come into play. 

Before this happens:

1. Know what you want.  I don't mean your mate must be a 10/10 would fuck, super loyal step ford wife of your dreams. I mean real shit. Like SHIT THAT EXISTS. Compatibility, mutual interests, sexual compatibility, etc. Where do you stand and how flexible are you? You need flexibility because compromise will be important. If you don't know his how can you ever be happy?

2. What type of relationship do you want? Long term maybe marriage, hook ups, short term, one night stand, fuck buddy? Be with the kind of girl that is looking for he same thing you are and will be good in that type of relationship. If you fall for your ONS and decide to marry her it may not go that well.

3. Don't lie, to yourself or her. It causes problems. Lie about yourself and your intentions and you've laid he groundwork to catch shit later. Lie to them and you're authorizing things you don't like. Your setting bad precedents. This is bigger in the workplace. Lying can cost you a lot. 

4. Be true to yourself. You must compromise but don't be so eager to please you become one of those people whose sole goal is to make the other person happy to the extent that your personality disappears and/or you become a doormat. 

5. Have a spine. It's hard to dump on someone with confidence that understands their self worth. 

6. Clearly define your boundaries. Discuss things and often. 

7.  Listen to everything someone says. If they are full of shit or have problems they will usually tell you directly or indirectly. Pay attention. Someone who is nice to you but not nice to the waiter is usually not a nice person. What hey say while not being directly questioned or just pops up may be the most truthful because, I their guard is down, they are speaking off the cuff not trying to feed you bs or something you want to hear. 

8. Communication. If you've got it great. If not you're fucked. 

9.  Watch what you say. Not every though you have is valid or appropriate. Anything you say can and will be used against you later. 

10. It's all politics. Understand the relationship dynamic  it will have a bearing on how you should proceed. Having a problem with you SO or boss, there are always other ppl in play. Are they helping you, hurting you, fucking you over?

10. Cover your ass. 

11. DON'T BE STUPID. Many ppl get blinded by their projection of the situation and what they want. There is so much about this. Just don't be stupid and you'll be better off.

Hey everyone,

I'm sure many of us have seen the phrase ""Yes, Dear"" guy, referring to a guy who is always agreeable and never stands up for himself. I'm sure that some of us have been that guy at some point in our lives, and I'm sure many of us have been on the receiving end of it.

Most guys just dismiss this when it happens, or let her have her way because its a nothing moment and it means nothing, but don't do this--if she is wrong, make sure she is capable of admitting that she can be wrong.

If she can't (especially if it's really unimportant) then you might be in for some really turbulent times.  Dating anyone who HAS to be right ALL THE DING-DONG TIME is absolutely exhausting and will murder your happiness.

Exercise is known to cause inflammation, but how is this different from chronic inflammatory responses that may affect mood?

Exercise-induced inflammation is a normal and beneficial consequence of physical activity. It is a short-term response to the physical stress of exercise that helps the body to repair and strengthen muscles and other tissues. Exercise-induced inflammation is characterized by a localized increase in blood flow, an increase in the number of white blood cells, and the release of hormones and other substances that help to restore the body to its pre-exercise state.

Chronic inflammation, on the other hand, is a long-term response to an ongoing stimulus. It is characterized by an increase in the number of white blood cells and the release of hormones and other substances that can cause damage to the body. Chronic inflammation is linked to a number of different conditions, including depression and anxiety.

The difference between exercise-induced inflammation and chronic inflammation is that the former is a normal and beneficial response to physical stress while the latter is a long-term response to an ongoing stimulus. Exercise-induced inflammation helps the body to repair and strengthen muscles and other tissues, while chronic inflammation can lead to damage to the body and may be associated with various conditions.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/science with title ""Exercise causes inflammation too, how is this different (or is it) from chronic inflammatory responses that may affect mood?""","Maybe I'm missing a big point, but if I may propose some follow-up questions: How is this different from the inflammation caused by strength training? When correlations are made between mood and exercise, it often seems the consensus is that people who exercise regularly are happier. Is this more for aerobic? Does the decreased inflammation throughout the entire healthy body outweigh the inflammation caused by exercise? Is there correlation between resistance training, where there can be a substantial inflammatory response, and depression?

I realize /r/science and there may not be much more than speculation out there at this point, but just fuel for discussion/thoughts.

tl;dr - Exercise causes inflammation too, how is this different (or is it) from chronic inflammatory responses that may affect mood?"

I'm a long-time Star Trek fan, so I'm used to the idea that the franchise has had its ups and downs. But lately, it seems like there's been a huge influx of new fans, and I think that might be the problem. 

But that's not necessarily a bad thing. New fans bring new perspectives, new interpretations, and new ideas. They also bring a sense of energy and enthusiasm that can help keep the franchise alive. And if they're passionate enough, they might even help to create a new generation of Star Trek fans. 

So while I may not always agree with the opinions of these new fans, I do think that their presence is a good thing for Star Trek. After all, without them, the franchise might not even still be around.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/startrek with title ""New fans might be the problem but that may not necessarily be a bad thing.""","Personally, I think one of the main reasons that this is occurring is because long-time fans of the franchise and new fans of the franchise have a difference in their collective knowledge regarding the various series. 

Speaking as a relatively new fan of the franchise (I was introduced to TNG as a kid, but I didn't become a big fan until recently), I feel intimidated freely discussing my thoughts on this subreddit because I assume that most of the people here have been fans of the franchise for quite some time. I figure that most people here already know far more about the franchise than I do, and if I were to bring up a question or make a comment, it would either be an idea which has already been expressed before, or it would be quickly dismissed by someone more knowledgeable than I am on the subject. I feel stupid looking at the weekly episode discussion even if I have seen the episode (I've only finished TOS, TNG, and the first three seasons of DS9) because on the occasions when I have read that thread, others have already made far more interesting comments about the episode than I could have ever thought of. 

While I used to just pass this off as me being insecure about coming off as stupid in front of strangers, I can't help but think that other new fans feel similarly. I've seen a lot of ""where should I start?"" threads on this subreddit recently, and I think it's because a lot of people are like me and are trying to get into Star Trek either because of the reboot or because of the availability of all the series on Netflix. Regardless of the reason, there are a lot of fans who I think would like to participate in discussions, but they either feel intimidated by the thought of expressing their ideas in front of people who they feel are undoubtedly more knowledgeable, or they are afraid of having something spoiled that they haven't seen yet. For example, I found out about the death of at least one or two characters on threads that I figured would be spoiler-free. Obviously, that's the risk you're taking when you read a thread, I realize, and I can't expect everyone to not spoil anything (how could you have a discussion about certain topics without any spoilers?). Nevertheless, it does make me not want to read the threads regarding actual episodes/characters/series/etc. 

Which brings me to the point you've made; many of the most-upvoted posts end up being Star Trek merchandise of some sort. I think this is because this is something that regardless of our involvement with the franchise, we can all agree on. If we like somebody cosplaying as one of our favorite characters, it doesn't matter if we've been a fan for a year, or for fifteen years, because we can upvote it and like it all the same. I think that's also why the reboot has been talked about so much in recent posts. ""Into Darkness"" is coming out relatively soon, and it will put us all on a level playing field again. Because this is new canon for all of us, we can all make our own decisions about what is good and what is not and what statements they're trying to make in the film and so forth. I realize that people who have seen TOS will have a slight advantage over those who have not in these discussions, but with as much as Abrams has changed in the reboot (and with as much as he likely will continue to change) I don't think most people will had to have seen TOS to make interesting points and observations about ""Into Darkness"". 

Of course I realize this is all my take on things, and I could be completely misrepresenting new fans. I'm also not saying that there shouldn't be discussion of episodes/ideas/etc. in this subreddit. On the contrary, I'd love to see more of them. I've just tried to explain why I think many people aren't getting more involved in the discussions. If the problem really is that new fans aren't stating their opinions because they are intimidated or worried about spoilers, perhaps there is something we could do to ease their minds about those things. I think that new fans could really offer a different perspective on some things and could potentially generate a lot more discussion if they felt comfortable doing so. I'd really like to feel like a more productive member of this subreddit, but I'm usually too nervous to do so. 

**TL;DR** New fans might be the problem but that may not necessarily be a bad thing. "

Hi everyone, 

I'm a 20 year old female and I've had gratification disorder (AKA infantile masturbation or benign idiopathic infantile dyskinesia) since I was a baby. I've been masturbating for as long as I can remember and I'm feeling really embarrassed and ashamed about it. I'm also worried that it's going to affect my relationships and sex life in the future. 

I was wondering if anyone else has had this condition and how they've managed to cope with it. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskWomen with title ""Had gratification disorder (AKA infantile masturbation or benign idiopathic infantile dyskinesia) and have been masturbating for as long as I can remember.""","I actually had gratification disorder (AKA infantile masturbation or benign idiopathic infantile dyskinesia) so I have been ""masturbating"" for as long as I could remember.  As a young child I would actually lay on a chair or similar object and the pressure on my clit would bring me to orgasm.  There was sometimes a bit of humping involved, but not really.  It's hard to explain.  I never understood why I got in trouble for doing it so I would do it behind closed doors and do everything I could not to get caught.  It felt good and my parents never told me *why* it was bad so I did it anyway.  
I also enjoyed riding in the small seat/shelf in shopping carts for the same reason.  As a female I was able to press against the metal bar that went between my legs and it felt good.  My parents didn't know I was doing anything bad -- which I liked -- but it took longer to reach orgasm and sometimes didn't work at all -- which I didn't like.

It wasn't until I was much older (and even a bit after my ""birds &amp; the bees"" talk) that I realized I was actually *masturbating* and that I understood why my parents would yell at me for doing it.  I felt so stupid and it felt so wrong.  
Even after this discovery, however, I continued to masturbate in the same way because I didn't know any different.  Eventually I learned ""normal"" ways of masturbating and have only gone back to ""chair humping"" **once** when I couldn't orgasm after over an hour and was *very* frustrated.  I was able to orgasm with my old method but it wasn't very satisfying.

We all have different beliefs and opinions, and it can be hard to decide what is the right thing to do in any given situation. That's why I think it's important to remember that each situation is different and that it's okay to do what you feel is right.

No one else can tell you what the right thing to do is, so don't be afraid to make decisions based on what you feel is right.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/agnostic with title ""Each situation is different, do what you feel is right""","There seem to be mixed opinions here, and none of them are wrong.
This is a case-by-case kind of thing; it depends on how you feel and how your family is. 

Here is how things went for me:
I was 16 or 17, I don't really remember. I had gone to a Catholic elementary school, but a public high school. In high school I went to the ""Sunday school"" that my family's church had for teenagers preparing to be Confirmed. I did everything I was required to be Confirmed, and decided not to. If you're Catholic, you know what Confirmation is, and I couldn't go through with it because it felt dishonest since I was agnostic. I ""came out"" to my father (the most religious in my family) in a meeting with my pastor that I had scheduled to let them know I didn't want to be Confirmed.

They were very understanding. My pastor actually agreed that I shouldn't be Confirmed if I didn't feel like I was truly Catholic, and encouraged me to find my own spiritual path. My father just wanted to understand, and while he seemed disappointed at first, I talked to him for hours explaining how I felt and what I believed and why I didn't feel those beliefs were compatible with Catholicism. 

My family accepted who I am and what I believe, and my dad stopped pressuring me to go to church with them, lead grace at dinner time, etc. I do still go to Mass with them at Christmas, Easter, and things like that, just because I think it's important to do something as a family, and I want to support they're beliefs just like they do for me. In fact, this past Christmas I was the only one that didn't complain about the super long service.

But this is my experience, with my family. I know parents who would respond much more negatively, and you should be cautious. You know your family and only you can figure out how and when to ""come out.""

Hey everyone, 

I'm sure many of us are trying to lose weight and it can be really difficult. I'm here to share with you some tips that have been helping me in my journey. 

First, tracking your calories is essential. There are many great apps like MyFitnessPal.com that make it easier to keep track of what you're eating. This also helps you to be more mindful of your caloric intake. 

Second, try to avoid drinking your calories. Sugary drinks like soda and juices can add up quickly. Instead, try to drink more water or unsweetened tea. 

Third, try some new healthy foods. You may be surprised at how low in calories some of these foods are. For example, salsa is surprisingly low in calories for the flavor. 

Fourth, celebrate your wins. Even if you have a bad day, don't be too hard on yourself. It's natural to have ups and downs in your journey. 

I hope these tips are helpful to you. Good luck on your journey!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/loseit with title ""Track your calories using Myfitnesspal.com or other trackers.

 Don't be too hard on yourself on the bad days (I struggle with this sometimes, it's natural)""","I feel you man. At my heaviest I weighed 287 and it hurts to just live overweight. The guilt of what you're doing to your own body can really, truly hurt. It's good you are having this wake up call though. Changing your mindset is a huge part of changing your life.

Weight loss is made in the kitchen and it was a hard fact for me to handle. Exercise helps but improving your diet is #1. Start tracking your calories, I use MyFitnessPal.com (it's free) but there are other trackers out there. Record everything you eat to the best of your ability. Even on your bingier days you'll notice that you eat better when you're watching it.

Experimenting with food helps a lot too. You could really love some healthier foods but you'll never know if you don't give them a try.

Also try to stay away from soda. I try not to ""drink my calories"" and stay with just water, and a black coffee if I'm feeling tired at work. Three 20 oz bottles of soda are as many calories as a fairly large dinner.

I'm nowhere near an expert but all of these changes have helped me lose about 46 pounds so far, and I'll keep using them to lost the last 40ish I need to hit my goal. Every 10 or so pounds you can feel a change in your body and it feels great. Celebrate these changes and be proud as your weight goes down.

Oh and also it isn't the end of the world if you eat too much in a meal or day. Don't get discouraged or beat yourself up just remember to do better in the future.

Wow that was a lot of stuff.

1. Track your calories using Myfitnesspal.com or other trackers.

I recently made a decision to invest $31,200 into a medium-risk mutual fund. I'm doing this to help my future self. I plan to use the dividends earned from the fund to pay for my gym membership. I think this is a great way to save money and still stay healthy. I'm excited to see what the future holds and how much money I can save in the long run.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Fitness with title ""invest $31,200 into a medium-risk mutual fund and use the dividends earned to pay for your gym membership.""","I'm not entirely sure this is a serious question.

Your average gym membership is $40/mo. That breaks down into roughly $10/week or $2 per weekday (most people don't hit the gym on the weekend, but we need this number later, so it ends up being roughly $1.43/day). In order to recoup your losses to the gym, you need to be able to make back $1.43 while at the gym every weekday.

I suggest investing into a medium-risk mutual fund. I had success with the T.Rowe Price mutuals before with returns on average around 6% (beating out the national average when banks were giving decent interest rates on savings accounts by a whopping 3-4%). Therefore, in order to make (on average) the $1.43 required, you would need to have almost $8,500 invested to ""get swole off the interest"".

EDIT: In fact, you wouldn't need that much since I ballparked; a more accurate daily-cost would be that $40/mo * 12 / 356 (which is $1.35). If we assume that down years drop to 2% return, and that would be a really down year for a medium-risk investment [casual aside, during the housing market crisis I had a medium-risk investment with T.Rowe Price and it returned 4%, so we're being pretty cautious here], then you would need $24,000 invested to cover the cost in earned.

Also, and this does warrant being brought up, but these are dividends and therefore are taxable. You will have to look to your own tax bracket to determine exactly how much you will end up paying to the government, but you can usually assume that 30% will cover it; so take whatever investment is required, and we'll use that $24,000 for our example, and add an additional 30% to cover the taxes lost (though these are not strictly linearly related, we can basically treat them that way for small amounts).

tl;dr - invest $31,200 into a medium-risk mutual fund and use the dividends earned to pay for your gym membership."

Two, only take hits from said vape through your nose. It's really tough at first, but trust me, if you're persistent it gets much easier.

You'll get one, maybe two, sinus infections at first; but with repetitive use, your sinus cavities will have hardened to a tough-ass mofo that can eventually handle the burning of full-on smoke from bones and even blunts. I've been smoking through my nose like a pro for years now. Remember, when life hands you a bad case of acid relux, don't p*ssy out and give up smoking; hit that shit through your nose like a real man.

You can astound people with your manly ability to smoke even the harshest and loosest blunts through your nose without even flinching. Guys will want to be you. Women will want to be with you.

I recently got my hands on an old straight razor and have been using it to shave my face. I have to say, it's much nicer to shave with than a shavette. The straight razor gives me a much closer shave and is much more comfortable to use. Plus, it's just a beautiful piece of craftsmanship. 

If you're thinking of getting into straight razor shaving, I'd highly recommend it. It's worth the investment of time and money to restore an old straight razor and use it to shave. It's a great way to get a close shave and appreciate the beauty of a finely crafted tool.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/wicked_edge with title ""Straights are much nicer to shave with than shavettes, and you'd be better spending your money restoring that beauty.""","I actually switched from Shavette to straight razor a couple days ago.

Since most shavettes use half a DE blade, I find their shorter length to be really annoying. Cream accumulates faster, and you have to wash it more often. Shavettes also tend to irritate your skin more in my experience. Every time I shaved with mine, I felt like a cactus. After switching, no irritation whatsoever.

Hey everyone,

I recently discovered a new way to make a delicious dish that I wanted to share. It's a simple but tasty way to make a meal out of almost anything.

Basically, you take whatever ingredients you want to use, stuff it with breadcrumbs, drizzle with olive oil, and then pressure cook it. The result is a flavorful and juicy dish that's sure to please.

I've been experimenting with different ingredients, like chicken, beef, and fish, and it works great with all of them. The breadcrumbs give it a nice crunch and the olive oil adds a nice flavor.

I'm sure you can come up with some creative variations on this recipe, so give it a try and let me know what you think.

Thanks!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskCulinary with title ""Stuff it with breadcrumbs, drizzle with olive oil, pressure cook, enjoy""","I'm from the States, but my family is Italian and we've always prepared them the same was as far as I know. To me, it's the best way to eat an artichoke.

1. Hit the artichoke on the counter upside down a few times- This loosens the leaves.
2. Work the leaves a little bit to open them up and get some gaps in them.
3. Pour Italian breadcrumbs (or breadcrumbs flavored with Italian herbs) into the leaves. Make sure to get breadcrumbs down in all the nooks and crannies.
4. Drizzle olive oil over the entire artichoke. Not so much that you're soaking the breadcrumbs, but enough that the breadcrumbs are moistened. (Too little and it will turn out dry, too much and it will be soggy).
5. Put the artichoke in a pressure cooker and allow it to steam for about 20 minutes, then turn off the heat and let it sit in the cooker until the pressure subsides.

Eat it by pulling off a leaf at a time and scraping it against your teeth.  You get the flesh of the leaf and the breadcrumbs with each bite, and the stalky part is left behind.

After you eat the leaves, the heart is left. Cut off all the fuzzy stuff because it's sharp and will make you choke.  Then eat the heart, it's the best part!

Hey everyone,

I'm a 2L at a top 10 law school and I wanted to share some advice for those of you who are considering law school or who have already started.

First, know your stuff. Law school is hard and you need to be prepared. Make sure you understand the material and have a good grasp of the law.

Second, work during your summers. Law school is a great opportunity to gain experience and make connections. Working during the summer is a great way to do that.

Third, make sure you do good (and clear) work. Law school is all about the details. Make sure you pay attention to the details and make sure your work is clear and understandable.

I hope this advice helps. Good luck!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/LawSchool with title ""Know your stuff, work during your summers, and make sure you do good (and  clear ) work.""","It's not as bad as the hype says it is. Remember that the stories you hear only come from the people that care to tell them, and the people who did sink $150k into school and now don't have a job usually care about telling their story (and telling it loudly). The people who don't have a problem finding jobs don't take to the internet and post about it.

Also contrary to popular belief, you don't need to go to a T20 or a T14 or a T6 school to land a job. Take, for example, the Denver area job market - it's dominated by CU, which is well into the latter half of tier 1 schools. Same things in Seattle - UW and SU dominate the market, UW being ranked similarly to CU, and SU being midway through tier 2 (I think they are like #75, but are also #1 for legal writing... case in point - who really believes the ""rankings"" ?)...

My experience? Without being too specific, I had a 3.9 GPA and an LSAT in the low 160's. Got into some great schools, transferred from a public to private school (which is WAY better IMHO). My law school GPA isn't great, but not bad either, and I have a steady job as a law clerk. I'm not really that worried about finding a job after graduation... by now I'm familiar with the work of the major firms in the area and talking intelligibly in an interview about the areas of law I'm interested in is not a problem at all...

TL;DR - Know your stuff, work during your summers, and make sure you do good (and *clear*) work."

Google Products Liability, Manufacturing Defects

It's been revealed that Google has been dealing with a major issue in regards to its products liability and manufacturing defects. Reports have come out that the company has been facing a lot of lawsuits over the past few years due to the fact that their products have been found to be defective. This has caused a lot of financial losses for the company as well as a lot of bad publicity.

Google has been trying to address the issue by taking steps to improve their product quality and safety. They have implemented a number of measures such as increased testing, improved inspection and quality control procedures, and better customer service. However, it seems that this has not been enough to stop the lawsuits from coming in.

It's clear that Google needs to take further action to address this issue and ensure that their products are safe and free from defects. This is an important issue for the company, as it can have a huge impact on their reputation and bottom line. It's time for Google to step up and take responsibility for their products and ensure that their customers are safe.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/worldnews with title ""google products liability, manufacturing defects""","In a products liability tort action involving a manufacturing defect, all the middlemen may be joined in the suit and found strictly liable (meaning they may be found liable without proof of careless or fault). The reasoning is that although they did not cause the defect, they nonetheless sold a product that was defective. Most jurisdictions impose joint and several liability, which means each of the defendants is liable for the entire amount of the damages though the plaintiff may only collect up to the amount of the injury (to clarify, if one of the defendants is insolvent or has no insurance, the other defendants bear the load so that the victim's collection is not reduced). 

There are two major schools of view in tort law, there is the non-instrumentalist view as nuttybuddy mentioned, that the purpose of tort law is to redistribute injury to compensate the victim because the corporations have deeper pockets and can more reasonably handle the damages. The instrumentalist view, which is more of an economical approach, is that the purpose of tort law is to discourage non-efficient behavior, making everybody better off as a whole.

You can use this sentence to see how the other is ambiguous:

&gt;My father nearly killed my mother when he was little.

Here, we understand that the father is the he and not the mother although it is a poorly constructed sentence. 

It seems to me that you might be missing that one of the foundations of humour is intentional misunderstanding, even when it means stretching the rules.

&gt;My mother nearly killed my brother when he was little.

If given this sentence, a comedian can still take advantage of the pronoun and use it to call the mother a ""he"". This is the nature of humour.

It's no secret that the Chicago Bears and Chicago Cubs share a lot of the same fan base.

I understand Chicago demographics...North side Cubs fans are the douchebag rich white people while the south side is lower class, more minorities and Sox fans. I'm generalizing here. The suburbs, the rest of Illinois and Iowa are Cubs fans for the most part. So it's safe to say that the MAJORITY of Bears fans are Cubs fans as well. Or at least, the Cubs are the most popular team among Bears fans. 

And yes, generally speaking, people from a city are fans of every team of that city. A transplant to Chicago will still cheer for his hometown team. A FIB who moves elsewhere will continue to cheer for the Chicago team. So saying someone will adopt the Cubs but not the Bears is pretty silly.

For instance, in most sports you score points or goals; in baseball you score runs. In most sports the ball, or object, is put in play by the offensive team; in baseball the defensive team puts the ball in play, and only the defense is allowed to touch the ball. In fact, in baseball if an offensive player touches the ball intentionally, he's out; sometimes unintentionally, he's out.

Also: in football,basketball, soccer, volleyball, and all sports played with a ball, you score with the ball and in baseball the ball prevents you from scoring.

In most sports the team is run by a coach; in baseball the team is run by a manager. And only in baseball does the manager or coach wear the same clothing the players do. If you'd ever seen John Madden in his Oakland Raiders uniform,you'd know the reason for this custom.

Now, I've mentioned football. Baseball &amp; football are the two most popular spectator sports in this country. And as such, it seems they ought to be able to tell us something about ourselves and our values.

I enjoy comparing baseball and football:

Baseball is a nineteenth-century pastoral game.
Football is a twentieth-century technological struggle.

Baseball is played on a diamond, in a park.The baseball park!
Football is played on a gridiron, in a stadium, sometimes called Soldier Field or War Memorial Stadium.

Baseball begins in the spring, the season of new life.
Football begins in the fall, when everything's dying.

In football you wear a helmet.
In baseball you wear a cap.

Football is concerned with downs - what down is it?
Baseball is concerned with ups - who's up?

In football you receive a penalty.
In baseball you make an error.

In football the specialist comes in to kick.
In baseball the specialist comes in to relieve somebody.

Football has hitting, clipping, spearing, piling on, personal fouls, late hitting and unnecessary roughness.
Baseball has the sacrifice.

Football is played in any kind of weather: rain, snow, sleet, hail, fog...
In baseball, if it rains, we don't go out to play.

Baseball has the seventh inning stretch.
Football has the two minute warning.

Baseball has no time limit: we don't know when it's gonna end - might have extra innings.
Football is rigidly timed, and it will end even if we've got to go to sudden death.

In baseball, during the game, in the stands, there's kind of a picnic feeling; emotions may run high or low, but there's not too much unpleasantness.
In football, during the game in the stands, you can be sure that at least twenty-seven times you're capable of taking the life of a fellow human being.

And finally, the objectives of the two games are completely different:

In football the object is for the quarterback, also known as the field general, to be on target with his aerial assault, riddling the defense by hitting his receivers with deadly accuracy in spite of the blitz, even if he has to use shotgun. With short bullet passes and long bombs, he marches his troops into enemy territory, balancing this aerial assault with a sustained ground attack that punches holes in the forward wall of the enemy's defensive line.

In baseball the object is to go home! And to be safe! - I hope I'll be safe at home!

A hacker is more like someone who isn't satisfied until he learns exactly how a certain technology or system works and is constantly trying to learn more.  Finally thanks for the Karma and I hope reddit enjoys my explanation.

Edit: Where I learned the little I know
- [Exam cram] (
-  

That is a very complicated question but, I'll see if I can hit some of the basics for you.

First you need to know what hacking is

- Hacking is using or accessing a technology in a way that is contrary to the intentions of, or permissions given by, the owner, operator, or creator of said technology.

So in layman's terms, Hacking is using flaws in technology to gain access to, or change, information on a computer system.What are these ""flaws""? Well, that is when it starts to get complicated. Just know that these flaws can usually be narrowed down to three categories: human, hardware, and software.  I'll try to give a decent example of each.

Human: One of the easiest things to protect yourself from, and one of the most common techniques, is tricking people into giving you access to their systems. This can easily be done on people who have a limited understanding of computer security or people who don't practice proper security measures. This kind of hacking is commonly referred to as ""social engineering"". It is also the kind most often used by famous computer hacker and security expert Kevin Mitnick. If you want to know more about the life of a hacker then google him and read his books.

 Now an example, Let's say I work for company XYZ and my manager  is Mr Man. Well, Mr Man is a douche and I am planning on quitting soon but, before I leave I want to get some revenge on him by hacking his account. So here is what I do. I wait till Mr Man leaves for lunch then sneak into his office and get on his computer. I could access his account from my computer but the tech department would be able to see where I logged in from and realize that it wasn't logged in from his office computer. They would soon know something is wrong, and I don't want to get caught. So, there I am at his computer when suddenly my luck runs out, Mr Man had logged out and I don't know his password to get back in! That's when I remember, the new IT guy started today and they always make the new guys deal with simple or common problems at first. Since this is a new guy I am confident that he won't know best security practices and, I'm certain I can trick him into getting me logged in. So I call the company tech department and say that I forgot my password and can't login. I'm in luck, they hand the phone to some guy and he sounds very nervous. This has to be him, I'm sure of it. So, I tell him that I'm Mr Man and that I seem to have forgotten my password. He is about to ask me what I assume would be a security question when I yell ""Shit, It's almost 3:00. Listen man, I have a very important client that will be here in a matter of minutes and I NEED to get back on my computer. I don't have time for the normal speel. Just get me a new password and let me get back to work or I swear you will lose your job faster than I can say 'you're fired', you understand me?"" Now a normal worker wouldn't fall for this but this guy was new and got scared. He fell for my act completely. Now with the new password in hand, I login to his account and get to work. Let's see... deleting all his documents? Sounds like fun! Download gay porn? Why not! After, a few minutes of this I leave and get back to my station. Now, because they don't have cameras inside they have no way to pin it on me and I quit work the next day and get away free. Mission accomplished!

Hacking lesson - 1) Normal people are ignorant of computer security, take advantage of them.

Hardware:

I want access to somebody's documents on their computer. If I had another computer I could use, I would simply remove the hard drive from this computer and connect it as a secondary drive on mine. I don't though, so instead I have to use my trusty flashdrive with a boot-able version of linux installed on it. However in order to use that I have to change the boot order, which is determined by the bios. I restart their computer and enter the bios setup... or try to anyways. It turns out that they have a password on their bios.Now what? Because of my knowledge of computer hardware, I know that the bios password is saved on the motherboard in the cmos, which has volatile memory. This means that if the cmos loses power, everything resets back to its default state and all passwords and other information (like time, date and boot order) are lost. So I simply open up the computer, find the lithium battery that powers the cmos and remove it. After waiting a minute to insure all the data is lost I put the battery back in and close up the computer. Turning on the computer, I try to enter the bios again. Success! It is no longer password protected. I then go into the section where you determine the boot order and change it so that the usb ports boot before the hardrive. Now I restart the computer again and wait. It worked! The linux login screen is now showing. I login to my account on the flashdrive and get to work. From the linux operating system I can access the info on the other hard drive. So, I grab all the files I want and copy them to my flash drive. I then log out, restart the computer and change the boot order back to normal. If somebody enters the bios they will know something happened when it doesn't ask for a password but, let's be honest. How often do normal people enter the bios on their computers?  Mission accomplished!

Hacking lesson - 2) Software security is useless without hardware security. Lock that shit up!

Software:

Software is much more complicated to explain. If you want know more about this start googling ""sql injection"", ""Javascript Injection"", ""DDOS"", ""bruteforce hacking"", ""URL Manipulation"" and any other term you come across while doing so. Just realize, these concepts maybe be hard to understand if you don't have a basic understanding of programming or how the internet works. I'll try to give a brief example though.

I was playing an MMO the other day and was just about to finish defeating a boss character when some asshole came by and stole my kill. Now, were it a normal monster I would just shrug it off and move on but, I had been trying to defeat this monster forever and was just about to win. I was pissed! So before the guy leaves, I pretend to thank him because ""I was about to die"". I then friend him so I can keep track of when he is online and remember his username. Later that day I get back on the game and check to see if he is on. He's not! I logout of my character and type his username in to the login screen. Using some online bruteforce hacking tools and a little coding of my own I put together a program that continuously tries to login to his account changing the password every time it fails. This program will cycle through all the upper case and lower case letters and all numbers, hitting every combination possible until it succeeds. With people who have long passwords or passwords with special characters this could take a long time, maybe even years. However most people don't use complicated passwords, especially on online games.

In a little over an hour I hear a beeping noise, the sound I programmed it to make when it succeeded. I head back to my computer and there it is. I'm logged in to his account! First things first, I open up another tab in my browser and log in to my account on the game. I then trade all of his best items over to my character, along with all his gold and anything else that looks useful. I could have deleted his character but I decided that him seeing the character without all of the items and money he had collected would be much more entertaining.

ELI5: Hacking is when someone uses their knowledge of computers and technology to break into a computer system or network without permission. It can involve breaking into computers, changing or deleting data, or manipulating a system to do something it was not designed to do. Hackers can also use their knowledge to spread viruses or malware, which can disrupt communication and cause computers to behave in unexpected ways.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/explainlikeimfive with title ""Hacking is breaking communication, lying to computers and making them behave in ways that are outside of its legitimate scope.""","I've been in the information security field for the past 6 years. Hackers are just 21st century con men. Computers communicate with each other, and when you have a computer you can control exactly what it communicates. Computers only know what they're programmed to know, they only react how they're programmed to react.

Web pages are clients that are programmed and then delivered to and rendered through your web browser, and web sites are server applications built to respond to the data sent from the client. Your computer acts as the client, running the web page you requested, and transmits information to the web server, running the server application the web page is communicating with.

Well, the programmer builds the web page, and they put forms for data in it (Like what is your username and password?), and when used appropriately, the server application should operate just fine. The problem is the client can manipulate any information going to the server that they want, and often the server never validates that the information coming through to it is legitimate.

Let's say I've built a simple web site and web page that acts as a simple addition calculator for you. So my web page has two number pads, one on the left and one on the right, and a button at the bottom that says ""Add!"". So let's select ""2"" on the left, and ""5"" on the right, and hit the button. Now your web browser takes this information from the web page, and transmits it to the web server, and the web server runs the application adding the two numbers together, and communicates the result of ""7"" to you through another web page. Well, that's great... it works... but what happens when we lie to it?

Lets now create our own client, and instead of having two number pads, let's create two text fields! Now instead of selecting ""2"" on the left, and ""5"" on the right, let's type in ""John"" on the left and ""Doe"" on the right. When we communicate this information to the server, what's it going to do? Our application only knows numbers, but now we've received two words! Because I didn't program the application to check for words, it's going to attempt to add them together, and [this kills the application.](

Now, this example isn't that bad. Sure, it breaks the application and it's techincally a hack, but what about a banking web application? Your online bank probably allows you to transfer money to an account, what happens if you try and transfer 100,000 when you only have $2.04? What about when you try to transfer -50,000,000,000 from Bill Gates (He won't miss it) account? If the programmer didn't make the application verify that the proposed transfer balance is between $0.01 and your balance of $2.04, it'll probably go through! Wouldn't that be something.

Tl;dr: Hacking is breaking communication, lying to computers and making them behave in ways that are outside of its legitimate scope."

Hey everyone, 

I recently had a discussion with someone about BIOS passwords and why they can't be reset. My argument was that, since the BIOS is stored on a chip on the motherboard, it's impossible to reset the password without physically replacing the chip. 

Using a USB flash drive to boot won't work either, since the BIOS password is required to access the boot menu. The post never mentioned having a bootable CD/DVD either, so that's not an option. 

Bottom line, if you forget your BIOS password, you'll need to replace the motherboard to get back in. 

Hope this helps!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/explainlikeimfive with title ""BIOS Passwords are not reset, that was my argument. Using a UFD to boot won't work in this scenario either, and the post never talked about having a bootable cd/dvd. 
 Source: more years with hardware than you obviously...""","You can never open your mouth around here without some ""expert"" trying to one up you and back it with shitty credentials.

I'll bite, because you're wrong.

So, you're talking about resetting the BIOS to factory defaults, but not actually disabling the password. Problem with this: the SATA devices are usually still going to be first in the boot order above external USB devices. You can probably circumvent this by using a cd/dvd to boot as they are usually ahead of the SATA HDDs by default, or removing the HDD, but this isn't going to give you access to their data. In fact why don't you just remove the HDD and access it via a cradle if you're going to be ripping the internals out...?

Better yet just enable administrator account and set a blank password...

You make the point that less desktop PCs have proper hardware security... how many home users do you think have data worth stealing? The example was one in the workplace too. I'm going to assume the examples were not no-name brand hardware DIY machines.

The OP sounds like it was written by a kid who'd been fantasizing about doing something like this not someone who'd actually attempted it. Probably explains why they deleted, so many holes in the argument put forward...

Hey everyone! 

So, some hackers use a combination of malicious software, known as a trojan horse, to gain access to your computer and steal information. A trojan horse is a type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate program or file. It can be used to install other malicious software or spy on your activities. 

Basically, the hacker will send you a seemingly harmless file, like a game or a document, but it actually contains malicious code that will install other malicious software on your computer. This software can be used to steal your passwords or other sensitive information. 

So be careful when downloading files from the internet, and make sure you have a good antivirus program installed on your computer! 

Hope that helps explain it!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/explainlikeimfive with title ""Some hackers use a combination, such as trojan horses""","you forget to mention that some hackers use a combination of those ways you have stated. We have all heard of a trojan horse, which catogory do you think that falls under? A RAT for example, which is legal and easy to obtain, crypt, bind, and use.

For clarity;
Trojan horse: a computer virus that allows a hacker access to a computer.
RAT: Remote Administrative Tool, a trojan horse used in schools and workplaces everywhere which allows a user to view, keylog, an control a target computer.
Crypting: A process of encrptying a computer virus(or any program) and attaching a stub which decrypts the virus in RAM before running the virus. A good Cryptor will make a virus FUD.
Binding: The process of attaching a computer virus(or any program) to another file so that the virus runs when the file opens.
FUD: Fully Undetectable; the state of a program where when the program is tested against the 14 most popular antivirus softwares it will not be detected as a virus.

+++++++++++++++++++++++

That is a very complicated question but, I'll see if I can hit some of the basics for you.

First you need to know what hacking is

    Hacking is using or accessing a technology in a way that is contrary to the intentions of, or permissions given by, the owner, operator, or creator of said technology.

So in layman's terms, Hacking is using flaws in technology to gain access to, or change, information on a computer system.What are these ""flaws""? Well, that is when it starts to get complicated. Just know that these flaws can usually be narrowed down to three categories: human, hardware, and software. I'll try to give a decent example of each.

Human: One of the easiest things to protect yourself from, and one of the most common techniques, is tricking people into giving you access to their systems. This can easily be done on people who have a limited understanding of computer security or people who don't practice proper security measures. This kind of hacking is commonly referred to as ""social engineering"". It is also the kind most often used by famous computer hacker and security expert Kevin Mitnick. If you want to know more about the life of a hacker then google him and read his books.

Now an example, Let's say I work for company XYZ and my manager is Mr Man. Well, Mr Man is a douche and I am planning on quitting soon but, before I leave I want to get some revenge on him by hacking his account. So here is what I do. I wait till Mr Man leaves for lunch then sneak into his office and get on his computer. I could access his account from my computer but the tech department would be able to see where I logged in from and realize that it wasn't logged in from his office computer. They would soon know something is wrong, and I don't want to get caught. So, there I am at his computer when suddenly my luck runs out, Mr Man had logged out and I don't know his password to get back in! That's when I remember, the new IT guy started today and they always make the new guys deal with simple or common problems at first. Since this is a new guy I am confident that he won't know best security practices and, I'm certain I can trick him into getting me logged in. So I call the company tech department and say that I forgot my password and can't login. I'm in luck, they hand the phone to some guy and he sounds very nervous. This has to be him, I'm sure of it. So, I tell him that I'm Mr Man and that I seem to have forgotten my password. He is about to ask me what I assume would be a security question when I yell ""Shit, It's almost 3:00. Listen man, I have a very important client that will be here in a matter of minutes and I NEED to get back on my computer. I don't have time for the normal speel. Just get me a new password and let me get back to work or I swear you will lose your job faster than I can say 'you're fired', you understand me?"" Now a normal worker wouldn't fall for this but this guy was new and got scared. He fell for my act completely. Now with the new password in hand, I login to his account and get to work. Let's see... deleting all his documents? Sounds like fun! Download gay porn? Why not! After, a few minutes of this I leave and get back to my station. Now, because they don't have cameras inside they have no way to pin it on me and I quit work the next day and get away free. Mission accomplished!

Hacking lesson - 1) Normal people are ignorant of computer security, take advantage of them.

Hardware:

I want access to somebody's documents on their computer. If I had another computer I could use, I would simply remove the hard drive from this computer and connect it as a secondary drive on mine. I don't though, so instead I have to use my trusty flashdrive with a boot-able version of linux installed on it. However in order to use that I have to change the boot order, which is determined by the bios. I restart their computer and enter the bios setup... or try to anyways. It turns out that they have a password on their bios.Now what? Because of my knowledge of computer hardware, I know that the bios password is saved on the motherboard in the cmos, which has volatile memory. This means that if the cmos loses power, everything resets back to its default state and all passwords and other information (like time, date and boot order) are lost. So I simply open up the computer, find the lithium battery that powers the cmos and remove it. After waiting a minute to insure all the data is lost I put the battery back in and close up the computer. Turning on the computer, I try to enter the bios again. Success! It is no longer password protected. I then go into the section where you determine the boot order and change it so that the usb ports boot before the hardrive. Now I restart the computer again and wait. It worked! The linux login screen is now showing. I login to my account on the flashdrive and get to work. From the linux operating system I can access the info on the other hard drive. So, I grab all the files I want and copy them to my flash drive. I then log out, restart the computer and change the boot order back to normal. If somebody enters the bios they will know something happened when it doesn't ask for a password but, let's be honest. How often do normal people enter the bios on their computers? Mission accomplished!

Hacking lesson - 2) Software security is useless without hardware security. Lock that shit up!

Software:

Software is much more complicated to explain. If you want know more about this start googling ""sql injection"", ""Javascript Injection"", ""DDOS"", ""bruteforce hacking"", ""URL Manipulation"" and any other term you come across while doing so. Just realize, these concepts maybe be hard to understand if you don't have a basic understanding of programming or how the internet works. I'll try to give a brief example though.

I was playing an MMO the other day and was just about to finish defeating a boss character when some asshole came by and stole my kill. Now, were it a normal monster I would just shrug it off and move on but, I had been trying to defeat this monster forever and was just about to win. I was pissed! So before the guy leaves, I pretend to thank him because ""I was about to die"". I then friend him so I can keep track of when he is online and remember his username. Later that day I get back on the game and check to see if he is on. He's not! I logout of my character and type his username in to the login screen. Using some online bruteforce hacking tools and a little coding of my own I put together a program that continuously tries to login to his account changing the password every time it fails. This program will cycle through all the upper case and lower case letters and all numbers, hitting every combination possible until it succeeds. With people who have long passwords or passwords with special characters this could take a long time, maybe even years.

If this website followed good security practices they would limit the amount of login attempts possible from a certain IP address in a certain period of time or lock an account with to many incorrect login attempts. Unfortunately the creators of this game did no such thing. I head to the kitchen to fix myself some french bread pizza and wait. In a little over an hour I hear a beeping noise, the sound I programmed it to make when it succeeded. I head back to my computer and there it is. I'm logged in to his account! First things first, I open up another tab in my browser and log in to my account on the game. I then trade all of his best items over to my character, along with all his gold and anything else that looks useful. I could have deleted his character but I decided that him seeing the character without all of the items and money he had collected would be much more entertaining. Finishing up, I log out and continue on about my day with a smile on my face. Mission accomplished!

ELI5: How do hackers exploit people and technology?

Hackers are people who use their knowledge of computers and programming to exploit weaknesses in computer systems and networks. They take advantage of people who don't know enough about security and technology, or who have made mistakes when setting up their systems. They also use their knowledge of computers and programming to find vulnerabilities in systems and networks that they can exploit. Once they have access to a system, they can do things like steal data, install malicious software, or even take control of the system.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/explainlikeimfive with title ""They take advantage of stupid people, bad security and their own knowledge of computers and programming.

**goodguygreenpepper wrote this!**

Edit: Because of how popular this is getting I wanted to make a couple of points clear. First, I am not nor will I ever claim to be a hacker or even a script kiddie. I'm just a first year computer science student and these are the best examples I could come up with on short notice.None of it is real. Second, Yes I know a lot of this is outdated. It was written to be an example of how hacking works, not a technical manual. Third, I know that hacking doesn't explicitly, or even implicitly, mean breaking into a system. A hacker is more like someone who isn't satisfied until he learns exactly how a certain technology or system works and is constantly trying to learn more.

Hey everyone,

Today I want to talk about the importance of practicing your frame advantage after a step kick following a standing light kick. After a successful step kick, you're at frame advantage, so you should be looking to capitalize on it. One of the best ways to do this is to work on the 1f link (step kick >> st. hp). This is a great way to keep your opponent guessing and can lead to some big damage if done correctly.

Once you've landed the step kick, you can also press your advantage after a falling sky (hard knockdown). This is a great way to stay on the offensive and keep your opponent guessing. It also gives you a chance to set up a mix-up or a combo.

So, if you want to get better at SF4, keep practicing this frame advantage after a successful step kick. It's a great way to stay on the offensive and keep your opponent guessing. Good luck!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/SF4 with title ""Step kick after standing light kick, you're at frame advantage.
Work on the 1f link (Step kick >> St. hp)
Press your advantage after falling sky, as it is a hard knockdown. 
 Keep practicing!""","Good stuff man, just a few things:

After falling sky, GO HARD. Gen has a pretty weak defensive game, meaning after that falling sky &gt;&gt; backdash, I want to see you doing lk roll or mk roll to do a left right mixup.


After falling sky, backdash, lk roll.... you're still completely safe, if you instead do MK roll, you're still safe, but you have far less frame advantage to work with on your knockdown.

I saw you caught him pressing wakeup throw once with your cr. hp, that's good shit. Keep it up.

Also, I didn't see one step kick in st. hp. Not confident with the link yet, or just didn't think to do it? I believe from memory step kick &gt;&gt; st. hp connects on a crouching gen, which means you should do it most of the time you go for step kick xx dash.

Your mid game needs a little work. You're focusing too much and this gen should blow you up with hands. Instead look to press your advantage once you've landed a st. lk, as I believe you are +3 after hit. This means you can set up a step kick that has a 4 frame startup if you time it right.

You're going to counterhit gen a LOT if you try practicing this. 


TL,DR:

Step kick after standing light kick, you're at frame advantage.

I've worked on being able to read people's emotions, facial expressions and body language, but not everyone possesses the ability. If you want to gain this skill, I highly recommend reading books by Paul Ekman, especially Unmasking the Face. However, be careful with this ability if you do possess it. It can hurt more than help if you don't use it with care.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/IWantToLearn with title ""I've worked on being able to, but not everyone possesses the ability.

I learned a year or two ago. What she said earlier about the pupils, as an example CAN mean love/attraction (you can imagine why I told her about that one, I'm sure) but it can mean probably four other things. That's not really as important. 

If you look up the show you mentioned above, you'll see that the work that Dr. Lightman did is actually a true study. Paul Ekman is the real Cal. Unmasking the Face is one of the better books. 

It should be mentioned as a warning, that not EVERYONE possess the skill to read micro expressions. It's easy to get fooled, but that's typically if you're dealing with someone devious. Otherwise, it's pretty simple to read a person. However, I have a few friends who believe that they are naturals at this. I test them, and they are... Well, not. I let them have their fun, though. It's a fun thing to know, and it'll probably bring you joy next time you go to your significant other or a person you aim to date, and you can say ""hey, I can tell that he/she/it likes me!""

If you're looking for a great place to start with anime, I highly recommend checking out the original compilation movies from the classic series. You can start with Mobile Suit Gundam, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, and Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ. After that, I'd suggest watching Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team. It's a great show that follows a team of pilots as they fight to protect Earth from the Zeon forces.

The original compilation movies and The 08th MS Team are great starting points for anyone looking to get into anime. The stories are engaging, the characters are memorable, and the animation is top-notch. Plus, the original compilation movies are a great way to get a feel for the entire Gundam universe. So, if you're looking for a great place to start, give the original compilation movies and The 08th MS Team a try!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/anime with title ""Watch the original compilation movies and maybe 08th MS Team. Go from there.""","rockafella basically just listed off some of the major works in the original and most famous Gundam timeline, Universal Century. This is the stuff you want to watch if you want to know what Gundam is really all about. Since it's almost all older, it won't be as pretty, but if you want to catch all the references and stuff in other anime, this is what you want.

I kind of disagree with how he's recommending you watch it though.

I recommend you watch the three compilation movies for the original Mobile Suit Gundam. They hold up very well and are very enjoyable. After that, you should watch the series Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam. The compilation movies for Zeta Gundam aren't very good, IMO, and they have some altered scenes/plot. Officially, next comes Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ, which is... controversial. The first half is generally regarded as not very good, or at least very ""different,"" and the second half is more of a return to form. Some important stuff happens here, but I personally skipped it. Next comes the movie Char's Counterattack, which has a terrible plot, but *great* eye candy and some of the sickest mobile suit designs in Gundam. This is followed by another movie, F91, which will make no sense whatsoever, because it was originally planned to be a full length series. Then comes Victory Gundam, which I never watched, but is not generally regarded to be a very strong entry in the Gundam universe. Last comes Turn A Gundam, which is amazing, but very different from everything else in the franchise. It will also hold a lot more meaning for you if you watch it last, but it's good either way. 

The latest entry into the UC timeline is Gundam Unicorn, which is a very recent series of OVAs that are goddamned gorgeous with fantastic mecha designs. The plot... uh... it's okay. 

Stardust Memories (also known as 0083) and 08th MS Team are OVAs that chronologically take place between the original MSG and Zeta. There's another OVA in that same period, actually, which is probably better than 0083 called War in the Pocket (also known as 0080). It's great. 0083 isn't very good, IMO, but it's worth a watch for some really cool mecha designs and fights. 0080 is amazing, but it won't make much sense without at least the context of seeing the original stuff (also known as 0079). 08th MS Team is something you should watch regardless of how you feel about Gundam, but it's *very* different from how all the other series feel, so while you could watch it first, watching it won't really give you an idea of what Gundam is all about.

tl;dr Watch the original compilation movies and maybe 08th MS Team. Go from there.

I've been living in downtown Cincinnati for about a year now, and I absolutely love it. I'm not a suburb-hater by any means, but I think that living downtown in the city really makes Cincinnati seem so much better. It's just so vibrant and alive, and there's always something to do. Plus, the views of the river and the skyline are amazing. I'm so glad I made the move to the city, and I'm sure I'll be here for a long time!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/cincinnati with title ""I love it. I'm not a suburb-hater, but I think that living downtown makes Cincinnati seem so much better.""","I enjoy it a lot. Washington Park is beautiful, and the 1/3 or so of the Riverfront Park that is complete and open is great, too. I'm a runner, so Eden Park and Sawyer Point are close by and good for that. I walk to work, and it takes 10-15 minutes tops, with no possibility of a traffic jam. I'm pretty close to the Skywalk, too, so when it's raining or freezing about 80% of the walk can be in-doors and heated (with a few coffee shops and Subways along the way). There are events on Fountain Square all the time, and I can walk to a ton of restaurants and bars (and don't ever have to worry about a DD). Newport and Covington are a very short drive, a short bike ride, or a decent (but manageable) walk away. OTR is easy walking distance, and the architecture there is the best in the city. Shopping is about the same as in the suburbs if you want to go to a larger grocery store (unless you live near the OTR Kroger, which I've heard negative reviews about)--you'll probably have to drive to those, but it takes 5 minutes at most. Otherwise, you could shop at the smaller places (butcher, bakery, deli, etc.), or go to Findlay Market if you're in OTR (great place).

The downside is that I see the appeal of having a yard and a garden of your own. Sometimes I would like a private, quiet outdoor space where I can be on my own. Also, crime hasn't been an issue for me or my girlfriend, but the fact that it's a hub means that there could be people around that you don't want to deal with--it's important to keep an eye out, at least, but I feel like in all it's pretty safe as far as cities go. Sometimes I miss sports talk radio (believe it or not) or NPR when I'm walking, because I used to commute from Clermont County and listen to one or the other along the way. 

But even with those few downsides, I wouldn't change a thing and I'm absolutely in no hurry to buy a house in the 'burbs. I think my Cincinnati fantasy would be to renovate a place in OTR, build a garden on the roof, and live there until I'm shitting my pants and yelling at youngsters. I see downtown and OTR getting better in the next 5-10 years as population keeps going up--that sort of thing builds on itself in urban areas, and you can't underestimate how significant it is.

My favorite thing: over the summer, I could walk to as many Reds games as I wanted (or just sit in the Riverfront Park and watch the fireworks after the Friday home games). You could find seats in the upper decks for $5 or less on StubHub, and watch the barges pass by and see the hills in Kentucky. It was incredibly easy, and I loved it.

tl;dr - I love it. I'm not a suburb-hater, but I think that living downtown makes Cincinnati seem so much better."

Hey everyone, 

I'm trying to decide if I should add Paradox Plaza games to Steam, play them in tab out or windowed mode, or just stick with playing them on the Paradox Plaza. What do you think? 

I'm leaning towards adding them to Steam, as it seems to be the most convenient option and I'd like to keep all my games in one place. But I'm also worried that it might not be as enjoyable as playing them on the Paradox Plaza. 

What do you think? What are the pros and cons of each option? 

Thanks for your input!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/paradoxplaza with title ""Add to steam or tab out or windowed mode""","No there isn't for as far as I am aware, but there are some simple solutions to this:

- If you own the game on steam (or add the victoria2.exe to steam) you can press shift+tab to open the steam overlay. this features a clock.

- Alternatively you may press alt+tab or the windows button (assuming your keyboard has one of those) which will take you to your desktop which features a clock in the taskbar.

- You can also run the game in windowed mode. Windowed mode is not natively in the game's settings and must be activated by changing the game's settings file. This file is located under your documents/Paradox Interactive/Victoria 2 in the settings.txt file. By default this file will have fullscreen set to off, simply change fullscreen from yes to no. While you are here you may also want to edit the game's resolution so it doesn't take up all of your screen and you are still able to see the clock. in the end it should look something like this:

  gui=  
  {  
  language=l_english  
  }  
  graphics=  
  {  
  size=  
  {  
  	x=XRES  
  	y=YRES  
  }  
    
  refreshrate=60  
  fullscreen=no  
  shadows=yes  
  **and so forth**

XRES = horizontal resolution

YRES = vertical resolution

**DON'T FORGET TO SAVE YOUR SETTINGS.TXT**

I know it can be really hard to trust your partner, especially when it comes to their friendships with the opposite sex. From my experience I can say 99% sure nothing happened because you're in a relationship and friends respect that. She's just trying to protect you from your own anxiety and make sure that you're not worrying unnecessarily. 

However, I may be wrong and it's important to talk it out with her. It's important to be open and honest with each other in a relationship and to be able to communicate your feelings. If you're feeling anxious and suspicious, it's better to talk it out and get to the bottom of it rather than letting it fester and build up.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/relationship_advice with title ""from my experience I can say 99% sure nothing happened because you're in a relationship and friends respect that.

She was worried about this exact thing happening.  You're paranoid that something went down and that she's just trying to play cover up.  While it *is* wrong of her to try to be secretive of it, my gut tells me she's doing it on good intentions.  She thought more drama would come of telling you than of you never finding out about a non-eventful night. 

The other week, my best friend slept in the same bed as my then recently ex-gf... And since things were ugly near the end, she even made a threatening suggestion that something would happen when he visited.  But alas that was just a front.  And she later admitted that when he came over she had to clear the air about that cuz she thought I may have mentioned it to him (i didn't). At which point he completely agreed that nothing was going to happen. 

On a sidenote however, years before I dated this girl.  The same two had hung out secretly and at some instance drunkenly hooked up... And whether it was a different time period entirely or they were legitimately trying to cover up, they made it explicitly clear that nothing happened.  Since I found out about it so long after the fact, I couldn't piece together the actual time frame from when it happened and when they were telling me nothing was going on.  

**TL;DR** from my experience I can say 99% sure nothing happened because you're in a relationship and friends respect that. She's just trying to protect you from your own anxiety... But I may be wrong, so talk it out with her."

Bottom Line, we need to educate our kids, not just about guns, but in general. We need to create an environment where our children want to go to school, feel safe and happy there, and are motivated to become something. Removing violent video games isn't going to get us there, in my opinion. We need to focus on creating a positive learning environment, one that encourages our children to think critically, to ask questions, and to be creative. We need to provide our children with the tools and resources to help them succeed. We need to provide them with the support and guidance they need to reach their full potential. That's the bottom line.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Connecticut with title ""Bottom Line, we need the educate are kids, not just about guns etc, but in general.

Regardless of wether or not violent video games desensitize kids, taking them away isn't going to make anything better. If you take a negative away, without adding a positive, clearly you're leaving space open for more negatives. The best thing at this point, which is better said than done it seems, is to spend more effort in the school with children. We've heard it all before, but it's true.

There was an article I read a few days ago about the difference between violent video games in the US and say Asia. Even this they play just as many, if not more, violent games, you don't hear about them pushing to throw them away cause some crazed adult went on a killing spree.

I'm sure this isn't the typical post you'd find on r/pics, but I wanted to share this hilarious story.

So I was researching ""Anal Fissures"" on my laptop the other day, convinced I had one. Little did I know, my brother had been watching me the whole time.

Fast forward to my 21st birthday party, and my brother decides to share with the whole room what I had been researching. I was so embarrassed, but the whole room was in hysterics.

I guess the moral of the story is: always be aware of your surroundings!

Has anyone else ever had a similar embarrassing experience?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/pics with title ""Brother caught me researching ""Anal Fissures"", convinced I had one, embarassed me at my 21st""","I remember some time ago, when I was still living at home, I was watching the episode of The Office where they are talking about changing their insurance policy.

Being about 14 I decided a quick google was in order and so I went about it and ended up on wikipedia reading about anal fissures. Shortly after my brother came into my room to talk to me about something, we talked for a while and then he left. After he left it hit me. He had seen. He knew. I had been caught reading about anal fissures.

I forgot about this event until 2 weeks  ago at my 21st birthday party where my brother made a speech. It was the normal birthday speech with embarassing stories and tales of brotherly adventures.

It's amazing how fast you can get dehydrated. We often take for granted how much water our bodies need to function correctly. Even a small amount of dehydration can have a huge impact on our physical and mental performance.

We're driving down the road, vomit's spraying all around... and I'm in the passenger seat, wondering what the heck is going on. Turns out, a new study has found that cars may actually be making us sick. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have discovered that the air inside a car can contain up to 10 times more bacteria than the air outside. This includes bacteria that can cause food poisoning, respiratory infections, and even the flu.

When driving back, he launched a stream of vomit out the window. It was so sudden that he couldn't even ask his mom to stop the car. As a result, the whole rear end was covered in lunch.

Then 15 minutes later the mother launched a projectile of vomit at the steering wheel and the windshield. Luckily, she didn't freak out and managed to stop the car safely. 

She then opened the door and started puking on the road. The son (who was sitting in the front passenger seat) also started puking out the door. Must've been an interesting sight for other drivers, with both doors open and puddles of vomit around the car.

If you suspect you have norovirus, don't suffer through it. Going to the hospital is the best way to get proper treatment and avoid the worst of the symptoms. Norovirus is highly contagious and can cause severe dehydration, vomiting, and diarrhea. It's not something to take lightly, and if you can afford to go to the hospital, do it.

I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria a few years ago, and I've been on a long journey of self-acceptance and understanding. After a lot of hard work, I can confidently say that I no longer feel the same level of dysphoria that I used to.

I'm still gender non-conforming, and I still face discrimination in many areas of my life, but the dysphoria isn't crippling anymore.

* Long-standing and strong identification with another gender

* Long-standing disquiet about the sex assigned or a sense of incongruity in the gender-assigned role of that sex

* The diagnosis is not made if the individual also has physical intersex characteristics.

and

* Significant clinical discomfort or impairment at work, social situations, or other important life areas.

When I was a kid, I didn't know I was female. I thought I was the same as my younger brother. That matches the first requirement.

When I started showing signs of puberty, I attempted to stop my breasts from growing by putting Nair on my nipples. That would count under the second requirement. [It didn't work, by the way.]

I have no intersex characteristics so that's the third one done.

And for the fourth, I started refusing to go to middle school once puberty started. I felt awful being made to dress like a girl. Girls, trying to be helpful, kept trying to get me to wear make up and things. I ended up being homeschooled for middle school, but it set my education back quite a few years. More recently, I had a lot of trouble making new friends because I didn't want to have to explain my gender and past. Most of my friendships have been online, until recently. So it's affected my life in a lot of ways.

The first thing you learn is how seriously people take religion there, people ask about your religion/church going habits as a part of regular conversation. Sort of along the lines of 'what do you do for a living' sort of question. But anyway, one day my family and I come home to find some serious damage done to some of our property. Hole in our canoe, playground ripped apart, yada yada. We knew who it was, we sort of had this ongoing feud with some preteen wanna be gang-banger, and our neighbor watched them come and go from the yard. Things like this actually happened with unfortunate regularity, our area had started to experience urban sprawl from Atlanta (which we were close to) and we were disliked for being a white, atheist, northern family. So we initially talk to his mom, bring photos of the damage, mention our eyewitness, and basically state our case. We told them that if he comes over and cleans up the mess he made, we won't bring the police in on the matter. The mother refused to deal with us, (this wasn't the first time we had to talk to her about her ghetto-spawn) and was generally a bitch. Witnessing a lost cause, we leave.

My family has a few sayings regarding situations like these. The first is that no matter what you do, you cannot take back the fact that you have been victimized. The second is, you never bring the police to your house. No good can come of it. So, we decide it isn't worth bringing the fuzz into. Fast forward a few days, and this little shit is outside in our cul-de-sac with his friends, lingering outside our lawn. He and his friends are younger than I, but older than my brothers. Having been threatened by kids like these a lot, my brothers don't even want to go outside in their own lawn. I snap at this point. All the anger I've felt about what this kid has done, the intimidation my family has felt, the racism (strange hearing from a white guy, but its true) was let lose on this kid. To be honest, I can't even remember what I said, I was raging. At some point I called him a ""God damn cock-sucking piece of shit"" (Wow, right?) and one of our neighbors called the police. I never went to hit him or anything, but I could be heard screaming from inside others houses. When they showed up, the kid played up his fear, which he had been previously trying to hide. Cop took his story, and was going to arrest me for intimidation and blasphemy. (or something like that, this happened years ago) I couldn't believe it when he said blasphemy. I told him I couldn't wait to hear what the news would have to say about that, which didn't please him much. Thankfully my parents came out at this point and did a much better job of talking the cop down, even mentioning the back story of what had happened. Cop let me go, put a little fear in the kid, and left. We moved about a year later. Sorry about the novel, but some back story was necessary to put my shit-fit into perspective.

""It's been a few weeks since the Canadian government announced a ban on certain types of assault-style weapons. I'm sure everyone has their own opinion on the matter, but it seems like the government has overstepped their bounds in this case.

Many Canadians already had their own laws and regulations in place to control the sale and use of firearms, and while the government's intentions may have been good, I think they should have left it up to the provinces and territories to decide what was best for their own citizens.

Everyone (including the government probably) would have been perfectly happy if the government didn't shove their nose into this. It's not like the ban was going to make a huge difference in the grand scheme of things.

I don't know about anyone else, but I would rather a teacher just take the day off if they're not feeling well instead of coming in sick, doing a half-assed job and possibly getting the students sick as well.

Also, the article mentions hos Ontario reached an agreement with the Catholic teachers, and therefore the Public teachers are just being unreasonable.

Duncan is definitely not the best professor I've ever had. He's always late to class and he doesn't really explain the material very well.

Who is the real Chip Kelly?

Chip Kelly is one of the most enigmatic figures in college football. He is a man of many faces, having been a successful head coach at Oregon, a failed NFL coach with the Philadelphia Eagles, and most recently the head coach of UCLA. So who is the real Chip Kelly? Is he the innovative offensive mastermind who revolutionized college football with his fast-paced offense? Or is he the stubborn, rule-breaking coach whose teams were often plagued by off-field issues?

The answer may lie somewhere in the middle. Chip Kelly is a creative, risk-taking coach who is willing to push the boundaries of the game. He is also a passionate leader who cares deeply about his players and their success. Ultimately, Chip Kelly is a complicated figure whose legacy will be determined by his future accomplishments.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/CFB with title ""Who is the real Chip Kelly?""""","See Im not so sure about this.

Instead of overwriting the existing files, Steam will create a new folder with the same name as the game and download all the files into it.

Police are not necessarily bad, but I would rather have rules set up so that citizens can protect themselves if they so choose. The police are there to enforce the law and keep us safe, but in some cases, they can be overzealous and even oppressive. I think it is important to have a system in place that allows citizens to protect themselves, while still having the police available to handle more serious matters. This way, citizens can be empowered to take charge of their own safety, while still having the police there to help if needed.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/askaconservative with title ""police aren't necessarily bad, I would just rather have rules set up so citizens can protect themselves, if they so choose""","I dont thoroughly enjoy the idea of having armed police on campus but I understand the response. I lean more libertarian (so theres that), I also am not excited about the prospect of hiring some 100,000+ more federal employees and paying for their pensions.  My ideal solution would be as follows:

A full time school employee may concealed carry on campus, however, the gun can only be carried onto or off of campus 30 minutes before classes start and after the last class ends. During school hours the gun must be in a safe that requires keypad entry (or bio-metric entry, the teacher can choose), in a key locked cabinet in that teachers desk. The locked desk or safe is not to be unlocked during regular school hours. If the safe is unlocked during school hours it auto calls 911 and the school goes into immediate lock down. The program would be completely voluntary to the school (community) and its employees. 

Edit: the teacher must previous obtain a CCW, own their own gun, and pay for the safe themselves unless the local community wishes to. There will be no public record of which teachers have a gun on campus to prevent students from stealing said gun or targeting that teacher in an attack, police and the principal are to be the only ones allowed to officially know.

One Piece has been around for a long time, and when it first started it wasn't quite as popular as it is now. Back then, the show was seen as too edgy and not quite family-friendly enough. This isn't the case anymore however, and the biggest thing keeping people from watching One Piece now it seems is the length. The show has over 900 episodes and counting, and with such a long run it can be daunting for new viewers to get into it. But if you're willing to invest the time, One Piece has some of the best, most engaging stories and characters in any anime. So if you're looking for something to watch, give One Piece a chance and you won't be disappointed.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/OnePiece with title ""It wasn't edgy enough at the time. This isn't the case anymore however, and the biggest thing keeping people from watching One Piece now it seems is the length.""","I don't think it's because of of grey storytelling verses black and white. It's mostly because of at the time that the anime internet community blew up, people had just finishing watching Dragonball Z, and stuff like Cowboy Bebop, and wanted more battle series that were dark and violent. 

One Piece seemed anything but that. It's artwork (probably the biggest factor tbh as stupid as it sounds) was anything but serious or dark. It was super goofy, and not all that ""good."" Comics like Naruto and Bleach though? Way different they had artwork more in line with stuff like Dragonball Z and Cowboy Bebop, and although they had their humor, they started with a more serious tone. 

One Piece characters were a lot more ridiculous and silly looking as well for instance. Luffy himself, Zoro using three swords, Coby, Helmeppo, Buggy's whole crew, Usopp, Kuro's crew, etc. One Piece also didn't really grip me until the Arlong arc where we got good crew character development, and the first villain that involved more than just terrorizing the island of the week. 

One Piece also didn't kill anyone outside of a few characters in flashbacks, where as Naruto and bleach had characters dying.

From wiki:

&gt;The insurance certificate or cover note issued by the insurance company constitutes legal evidence that the vehicle specified on the document is insured. The law says that an authorised person, such as the police, may require a driver to produce an insurance certificate for inspection. If the driver cannot show the document immediately on request, and proof of insurance cannot be found by other means such as the Police National Computer, drivers are no longer issued a HORT/1. This was an order with seven days, as of midnight of the date of issue, to take a valid insurance certificate (and usually other driving documents as well) to a police station of the driver's choice. Failure to produce an insurance certificate is an offence. The HORT/1 was commonly known – even by the issuing authorities when dealing with the public – as a ""Producer"".

I'm so excited to share my story with you all! My husband and I had been discussing the possibility of having a baby for a while, but we hadn't made any real decisions. We were both in agreement that we didn't want to ""try"" to get pregnant until we were both ready. 

One night, my husband turned to me and said ""Do me a favor, get pregnant."" I was shocked, but I knew immediately that this was the sign we had been waiting for. We stopped using birth control right away, and I'm happy to say that I'm now 8 weeks pregnant!

I had run out of my birth control (nuva ring) and honestly was uninterested in going back to planned parenthood and facing the issue with insurance I had. I also didn't like the part of the city I had to drive to in order to get there, so it was a combination of laziness and being uncomfortable with the situation. We knew we wanted kids. So we just kind of splashed around in the shallow end for a while. Had unprotected sex, but would pull out. Then one day I straight out said that I didn't want to go back on birth control and my fiance at the time was totally fine with that. So we decided to continue our sex life, without precaution and see what happened. We weren't going to specifically try, weren't looking at ovulation, nothing like that... until one night after some passionate love making, my fiance looked at me and said, ""Hey, do me a favor... get pregnant."" So I got an ovulation app on my phone, found my fertile window was just days away. We ended up getting pregnant right away. My period was a few days late and I had no signs of it approaching like I usually did, so we bought a test. I waited till morning, but of course it was on my mind so I woke up around 5am and took the test. Within two seconds I could see the faint line and I knew. I went back to sleep with the test on my night stand and waited for my fiance to wake up. A few hours later we both stirred awake in bed and he looked at me and said ""So?"" and I got to say ""I'm pregnant."" We just held each other there for awhile. I will never forget that morning and I know just how lucky we are to have succeeded in conception so quickly and easily.

Hey everyone! 

My husband and I just found out that we're going to Vegas for the hockey playoffs! We've been wanting to go for a while and this is the perfect opportunity. We're super excited and can't wait to get there. 

I'm a little worried though because I'm pregnant and due in a few months. Has anyone else gone to Vegas while pregnant? Any tips or advice? 

Thanks in advance!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/BabyBumps with title ""Vegas & hockey playoffs""","Let's see... we got married in Feb 2010 and my birth control ran out around March/ April and we started 'trying.'  After a few months we started trying 'more'- I peed on sticks for a month to track my ovulation, I tracked how my body felt during each month and I made conscious efforts to say 'hey- i'm ovulating, sex tonight!'- not the most romantic but trying to accomplish a goal darn it lol.  A year or so goes by and nothing.  I talk to my doctor about how I have painful ovulation, he doesn't offer much and I should have switched doctors but I was afraid of IVF and such.  So we started looking into adoption and foster care.  I went to a meeting on foster care that scared the general crap out of me and didn't know what to do. All the while still having unprotected sex and hoping for the best.  
March rolled around and we had a business trip together to Vegas.  In between working we partied like crazy people.  The week was a serious blur, but towards the end I remember saying to my husband that I can't stress about pregnancy anymore.  It's always in the back of my mind and its killing me, I need a break.  No more worrying about it for a while.  I know a million people told me not to stress before but that is easier said than done, I had to hit my breaking point. 

So we came home and April was another blur.  Talk about partying- beerfests, hockey playoffs, tailgating, and then at the end of April I had an old friend in town for fleet week and I 'ended' the month with like 5 tequila shots, 5 beers, 2 cigars, and puking my brains out.  

2 days later I realized my period should be there or almost there and I had no usual spotting and didn't really remember having painful ovulation or over sensitive boobs.  I was like, could we be pregnant? We had a test in the cabinet that had been there like a year and my husband said take it in the morning.  6am I jump out of bed to pee on a stick like there was a fire under my ass.  A second moderate line, not bright but there.  OMG.  I looked at my husband in bed and my stomach turned and I said 'Holy shit I think we might be pregnant'.  He said Ok and rolled back over while I was practically shaking.  He is much calmer than me- he's like well there is nothing you can do at this hour.  Damn him and his good points.  He said wait 3 days and take a digital to be more sure.  So we did.  Friday morning woke up again like a loon and in under a minute we had a very clear 'Pregnant'.  I called the doctors office as soon as they opened and was there for a blood test in under an hour.  Waiting for Monday's confirmation was an eternity. 

Side story- that Saturday was cinco de mayo and my husband was like if you aren't drinking everyone will know we are pregnant.  So we got creative and I drank water out of a beer can all night (the bartender kept filling the bottle for me bc she thought this was awesome).  

Monday the doctors office confirmed it and now my due date is tomorrow.  I love our little story.

Hey everyone,

I've been playing League of Legends for a while now, and I've been in a couple of situations where I was faced with a bruiser coming my way with his teammates right behind him. I know it's tempting to flash away and try to get out of the situation, but I've found that it's often better to stay and fight the bruiser.

When you flash away, it gives his teammates a chance to catch up and join in on the fight. This can be disastrous, especially if they have crowd control abilities or burst damage that can take you down quickly.

On the other hand, if you stay and fight the bruiser, you can often take him down before his teammates can catch up. This gives you a chance to disengage or reposition yourself for the next fight.

So, if you're ever faced with a bruiser heading your way with his teammates closer, don't flash away. Stay and fight the bruiser and you'll often come out on top!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/leagueoflegends with title ""bruiser heading(!) on face with my teammates closer = dont flash

etc. 
All these above when you are out of postion and bruiser is followed by teammates. If he isnt followed just crush him, because HE is the one out of position and your teammates are closer.

Also dont take this like its the only truth - thats my style, mostly because I main no escape adc like ashe or kog

Hey everyone,

I'm sure many of you have had the same experience as me, where you're playing a game of League of Legends and you feel like you're not playing to your full potential. I'm here to offer some tips on how to maximize your utility in game and make sure you're playing at your best.

First and foremost, if your composition has a lot of crowd control, it's a good idea to run Cleanse. This will help you avoid being locked down by the enemy team and give you more opportunities to use your skills to your advantage.

Next, pay attention to key cooldowns on both your team and the enemy team. Knowing when certain abilities are down can be a huge advantage, so make sure you're keeping track of them.

Finally, be aware of the damage potential of the enemy team and try to position yourself accordingly. Be careful not to put yourself in a situation where you're taking too much aggro, and always have an escape plan in mind in case things go south.

I hope these tips help you all become better players and make sure you're playing to your full potential. Good luck!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/leagueoflegends with title ""Run cleanse if comp has good CC , use your skills to maximum utility ( especially traps ) , Look out for key cooldowns that lock you up and take advantage, know the enemies damage, be careful with the aggro your positioning brings, have an escape plan.""","First of all you should have ran cleanse because they were running some strong cc. You cannot afford to get initiated on by shens taunt and be debuffed by the damage reduction or get stunned by sona or feared by nocturne. Your net , your trap and your range should be enough to keep the divers at bay. In these cases placing a trap infront of you and microing around it makes it even harder for champions like those to go on you because they will get snared ( even if noct ults he gets snared ). Choose your targets wisely at first taking precautions about what cooldowns the enemy team has on their skillset. You knew Nocturne had randuins so you should not even try to get close to him or focusing him because it would lead you to get AS debuffed. Shen on the other hand can be ""ignored"" after he taunts. You can probably take a couple of hits from him and still be at like 55-65% at the end of a small skirmish. The main problem would be when both of them initiate on you. They become sort of an unkillable duo flying through the air which could take you down with ease. The only way to avoid getting focused is to not grow aggro or have an escape plan. You need to stay far when the teamfights initiate so that you become less prioritized over your teammates. This makes them focus them and not you and gives you free shots at them or maybe the other carries. If they do initiate on you anyways you need to have an escape plan up your sleeve. Net over a wall or flash, go into a bush to loose sight , place some traps etc...



Edit: TL;DR ) Run cleanse if comp has good CC , use your skills to maximum utility ( especially traps ) , Look out for key cooldowns that lock you up and take advantage, know the enemies damage, be careful with the aggro your positioning brings, have an escape plan.

I would say a Civil War is a protracted conflict (i.e. a real war) waged between combattants from the same ethnic/geographic/political area.  Think American, Spanish civil wars.  

But arguably the Spanish Civil War was a revolution against Franco as well.  It just led to a Civil War.  

So I guess another answer is that a civil war is a war, and a revolution is either fought (and won) against an oppressor, or over (and won) fairly quickly.  If you're fighting others of your culture/ethnicity/country and it's protracted, it's probably civil war.

The scale of electric energy is just too much greater than the scale of kinetic energy. You simply can't harvest grid-level waste energy from human kinetic energy. 

Electric energy is measured in kilowatts (kW) or megawatts (MW) and kinetic energy is measured in joules (J). The difference between these two scales is vast. For example, 1 kW is equal to 1,000,000 J. This means that in order to harvest the same amount of energy from a human, you would need to generate 1,000,000 J of kinetic energy. This is an incredibly difficult task as it would require a person to run for hours or days to generate enough energy to make a difference. 

The only way to realistically harvest grid-level waste energy from human kinetic energy is to use renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower. These sources are much more efficient at generating energy and can be used to power homes, businesses, and even entire cities. 

Thanks to these renewable sources, we can now harvest grid-level waste energy from human kinetic energy. This energy can be used to power homes and businesses, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and helping to protect the environment.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/science with title ""The scale of electric energy is just too much greater than the scale of kinetic energy.

There is about 720 Joules per gram in a lithium ion battery. 720 Joules in gravitational potential energy is how much it takes to lift 74 kg (full grown man) by one meter. How much fucking tapping from your finger do you think it'll take to produce 720 Joules? Do you think you could tap enough in your phone's battery life (about 48 hours) to make that much energy?

I had a friend doing a project at MIT, who was trying to harvest kinetic energy from a rainfall using piezoelectrics. I did a back of the envelope calculation - the amount of energy you could get from a block sized rooftop during a heavy thunderstorm could only probably charge 5 or 6 laptop batteries.

This is a really interesting question! The Romans did not have a paper archive because they wrote on perishable materials, such as papyrus and parchment. Papyrus was made from the pith of the papyrus plant, which was abundant in the Mediterranean area. It was a cheap and readily available writing material, but it was not very durable and would not last for centuries. Parchment was made from animal skins and was more durable, but it was also expensive and not widely available.

The Romans also used wax tablets, which were made of wood covered with wax. These tablets could be reused by smoothing the wax with a stylus and writing again. However, these tablets were not suitable for archiving, as the wax would eventually wear away.

The Romans did not have a paper archive because of the perishable materials they used for writing. However, they did have a system of laws and decrees which were recorded on stone or bronze tablets. These tablets were much more durable and could last for centuries, so they served as a kind of archive.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskHistorians with title ""there is no Roman paper archive because the Romans wrote on perishable materials.""","Paper (papyrus in the ancient world) can't survive in the long term except in special circumstances. It can be burned as you mentioned, but it's also vulnerable to water and humidity. If a piece of papyrus wasn't stuck in a cave in the Judean desert, buried under the sand in Egypt, or preserved by the eruption of Vesuvius, it hasn't survived.

Parchment, made from animal skin, was used in the Middle Ages and is stronger than papyrus. We still have parchment manuscripts from late antiquity that have survived intact, and more may yet turn up.

That said, the Romans did leave behind quite a bit of documentary evidence. Many papyri from Roman Egypt have been found, as have countless stone inscriptions from all over the empire.

It's been a long time since the Orlando Magic last made the playoffs, but this season is looking like it could be the year we make it back.

Probably and yes.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/OrlandoMagic with title ""Probably and yes.""","You can stay for the whole game, and the food pretty good (I actually think that the food is more than ""pretty good"", but none of my friends, or myself are blown away by it).

Hey everyone,

If you're looking to climb the ranks in League of Legends, you should know that the higher you get, the more people know how to counter Eve. Eve is mostly banned in higher elo games, so it's important to start learning other OP heroes to stay ahead of the competition.

Some great heroes to pick up are Ezreal, Yasuo, and Jhin, who all have strong laning phases and can carry games if played properly. I also recommend learning how to play champions like Jax, Akali, and Xin Zhao, who all have strong early game pressure and can help you gain an advantage in the early game.

Good luck on your climb!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/leagueoflegends with title ""The higher that you get, people know how to counter Eve well.  Eve is mostly banned so start to learn other OP heroes.""","I main mid but since I am at school, i'll respond to your questions in this thread and I can't go on my client. 

(IGN: Pho Oh Three)

My s2 Elo Range(2.2k-2.8k) played with all kinds of high elo top tier people.

My S3 Elo(2k+)


Generally in lower tier Elo range, Eve can stomp really well because in lower tier, lanes do not use pink wards to stop Eve ganks and would not have the game knowledge as much as higher elo tier players.

In Higher elo, teams will use pink wards to counter your early ganks and post level 6 ganks. 

And also in higher elo, most banned heroes atm are: Eve, Nunu, LeeSin, Katarina, Twisted Fate, Khaizx, Amumu, Pantheon, Shaco. 

So as you get higher, you will get less chances to play Eve so start to learn more OP heroes. There are alot of OP heroes and you can't ban them all. 

tl;dr: The higher that you get, people know how to counter Eve well.  Eve is mostly banned so start to learn other OP heroes. "

Hey everyone, 

I've been vegan for a few months now and I'm all for it, but I'm having a hard time finding a balance between being an ethical vegan and a healthy vegan. I'm all for following a plant-based diet but I'm also guilty of eating a lot of processed vegan food and not enough fresh fruits and vegetables. I'm also not very active, so I'm not getting the right amount of nutrients.

I know that a lot of people in the vegan community strive for a balance between the two, but I'm having a hard time finding it. Any tips or advice on how to find that balance between ethical veganism and healthy veganism?

Thanks!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/vegan with title ""FoK, but both could be better.""","I would say the two movies have a different focus – I would say, roughly: FoK -&gt; health benefits of veganism; Vegucated -&gt; everyday vegan life style.

I'd say that FoK is a way better *documentary* because it tells a story in a way that you want to follow even if you're not really interested in the beginning. The style is rather boring, classic interview-centered doc. But FoK basically makes a strong case.

I didn't get that feeling from Vegucated. The running time in Veg. is spent less on arguing convincingly for veganism but rather on tips for the everyday aspect. This will be interesting mainly for people who are already convinced. Also, to my taste, the movie wasn't very coherent in style and had a bit of exerted humor at points (e.g. the scene with the supposedly funny ""show"" about what's not vegan).

As much as I would subscribe to the message of either film, I'm afraid neither seems likely to convince many meat eaters to think again. If I was to show someone a movie that gets them to think about their dietary choices, I would rather show them [Our Daily Bread](

**TL;DR:** FoK, but both could be better."

I remember when I first joined the Air Force, I was so excited to be a part of something bigger than myself. I was ready for the challenge and the adventure. But then I got to my first duty station and I realized that it wasn't as glamorous as I had thought. The reality of the situation was that it was hard work and it was tough. I had to learn to accept that things weren't going to be as easy as I had imagined.

It was a tough lesson to learn, but it was a valuable one. I realized that sometimes, the things we think are going to be the most amazing, turn out to be the most challenging. But I also learned that the challenge was what made it so rewarding. I wouldn't trade my experience in the Air Force for anything.

.""","Most people confuse love with devotion.  People often think that they are in love because they feel like they can't live without someone.  Love is when you would go without, so that the other person can benefit.  I know that’s not a definition, but I don't think it can really be defined.  Its like ""seeing"" air.  You can't see it, you just see the results of it when you blow up a balloon.  


I think a good litmus test between love and devotion is, if the person would really be better off without you, and you encourage them to go.  Devotion would do anything and everything to keep that person in their life.  Love would support them and encourage them to go.  For example, if a boy falls in love with a girl but the girl is in love with someone who is on long-term military assignment far away.  When her love comes back home, a boy who really loves her will step out of the picture so she can be happy, while a devoted boy would try to convince her that the other guy left her and doesn’t deserve her.  The argument is invalid either way, since she will obviously do what she is going to do regardless of what the boy says.  Its just an example.

-One of the reasons I personally believe riot doesn't implement a direct skin viewer tool is because the image the skin splash has as opposed to the in-game model.

ELI5: Colorization is a process used to add color to old black and white movies and TV shows. It's not perfect though, because it's very difficult to accurately reproduce some of the colors that are farther away from blue in the rainbow.

Some of these old pictures and movies have period hand colored versions out there, my great grandparents have a photo that was hand colored by the photographer and likely represented truth fairly accurately as the photographer would have taken notes for coloration.

At the same time there are almost certainly times when attempting to reproduce the original color would not actually work well.  Again, as Polga mentioned, sometimes colors were chosen not because they look good in color, but because they produce a specific effect in black &amp; white.  It's a common misconception that B&amp;W responds to luminosity the same way our eyes do.  Particularly older film responds most strongly to blue and very poorly to red.  So if someone wore a brilliant red dress, it probably would look very dark in the final result.  You could not easily recolor this to produce that red, it would come across as burgundy.  So if you wanted to reproduce the scene as-shot (given you know all the original colors), chances are it's far more work than it's worth.

**TLDR**: It's actually very likely that there are many colors that are wrong, both because there's a lot of guessing, and also because colors farther away from blue in the rainbow turned far too dark to reproduce well.

I recently had an issue with some of my brass cases getting stuck in the chamber after shooting steel cases. After doing some research, I found out that this could be due to the fact that I was shooting brass cases after shooting steel cases. Steel cases are harder than brass cases, so when the brass cases are fired after the steel cases, the brass cases can expand to fit the steel cases and then get stuck in the chamber. If you are shooting a lot of steel cases, it is best to clean your chamber and barrel after each use to prevent any stuck cases.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/guns with title ""Shooting brass cases after steel may result in stuck cases.""","One thing I was hoping to see in their article but did not in my brief scan of it:

If you mix and match shooting brass vs. steel, you will probably see extraction problems.  I have seen this first hand myself.

My theory is this:  When a cartridge is fired, the case is ""fire formed"" to the chamber - it expands to fill it.

Brass, being softer and more malleable, tends to expand and stay, whereas the steel tends to expand and contract a bit more.

If you shoot steel-cased ammunition, you may end up with a dirtier chamber than when shooting brass, due to the steel case contracting after the initial explosion.  This allows some venting back past the cartridge and puts residue in the chamber.

If you then subsequently shoot *brass* cartridges, they fire-form to the now residue-lined chamber walls, *and will frequently stick there* due to the residue left from the previous steel cases.

**TL;DR** Shooting brass cases after steel may result in stuck cases."

It's easy to get caught up in the idea that more regulation is always better, but it's important to remember that there can be unintended consequences of regulation. We've seen this in the past with things like the War on Drugs, where the regulations have led to a host of unintended consequences, such as the growth of the prison industrial complex and the erosion of civil liberties. This makes me wary of forcing the issue when it comes to regulation, as we may not be aware of the long-term implications of our decisions.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/skeptic with title ""Unintended consequences of regulation makes me wary of forcing the issue.""","I had to loop up the meaning of iatrogenic infection.

In any case, I'm all for informing the sector. Even for strongly urging everyone to take flu shots. But I doubt making the shots mandatory would have the desired effect. (Same goes for firing nurses.)

First reason is the general dislike people have of authority telling the people what to do. Making anything mandatory will cause friction. In this case that would probably mean more time for anti-vaccers in the spotlight. On top of that, since nurses are a representation of the population (of which still a significant portion doesn't like taking flu shots), forcing shots on the sector might lower the influx of new nurses. And I think there's already a shortage of nurses right now (at least, that's what the media here in the Netherlands tells us).

It seems like lately, more and more companies are instituting policies to prevent customers from using their products in ways that could potentially harm themselves or others. This is especially true in the vaping industry, where companies are required to take extra steps in order to protect their customers from potential health hazards. 

This is mainly due to the fact that the vaping industry is heavily regulated, and companies are being forced to take these policies in order to avoid massive fines. While it may seem like a burden to some, it's important to understand that these policies are put in place for the safety of everyone involved. Companies are forced to take these policies due to the potential for large sums of money going out the door if they don't comply.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/electronic_cigarette with title ""Companies are forced to take this policy due to $$$ going out the door.""","Not sure if this will be seen but working for a large vendor has taught me a lot. One I'm not sure how folks claim this is BAD customer support. Bad customer support would be totally leaving you out to dry. Bad customer support would be having no fix at all. Bad customer support would be calling you a liar and telling you they didn't do that.

There are two things to remember here. The first being that a company gets scammed all the time. Anyone who has worked in any type of retail situation whether online or off knows this. So you create a few hoops for scam artists to jump through. Most scam artists or people just looking for freebies will go the most simple basic route possible. By having them do something this makes it less desirable to lie and try to cheat the system you help curb this. Two, it is really expensive to have a system like Amazon or Zappos. Those companies make hundreds of millions of dollars. So they can afford to securely keep credit card information on file and afford to have a deal worked out with FedEx/UPS to get a break on the cost for shipping an empty box and getting a return tag. Long story short if you're an online company for the most part your only option is to have the customer mail the item back. Think about what happens when you don't return the original item to Amazon. You get charged for it. So in order to again stop scams some fail safe needs to be there. In Amazon's case it's keeping credit card information on hand, so that is how they avoid number 1. Small companies do not have this option. 

This also helps with diagnosing future problems. Of course in this case it was simply an error of putting the wrong item in a bag, but still the policy does help with that. 

Now should they cut you break? I guess that's up to them...however they are simply doing what they have to do to survive. I have a hard time believing they wouldn't comp you store credit for the cost of shipping.

Just MHO.

Bringing Bibles and food to people in need is often seen as a way to help those in poverty, but it doesn't do as much good as we think it does. Not everyone is religious, and many people in need don't have access to the resources to cook or store the food. Instead, it's better to focus on providing access to education and job opportunities, as well as providing basic necessities like clothing, shelter, and healthcare.

I just got back from a mission trip to Africa and it was an eye-opening experience. I was expecting to be able to help people, to make a difference, but instead I found myself doing nothing but sitting around and listening to people preach. I was so disappointed and frustrated that I lost my faith in the power of missions. 

I'm sure there are plenty of mission trips that do great work, but this one was not one of them. It felt like a waste of time and money. We didn't even get to interact with the people we were supposedly helping. It was just a bunch of people preaching and trying to convert people to their religion. 

I'm sorry if this is too much text. I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm still struggling to process what I experienced and I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to regain my faith in mission trips.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/atheism with title ""Sorry for all the text.

I was sixteen, brainwashed, and on fire for this trip. Total cost PER PERSON to go? $2,300. As a team, we held fundraisers, we spoke each and every Sunday and Wednesday at church to encourage people to give money toward this great cause and the great work that we were going to do. We basically told people that they were wrong and selfish if they didn't support the missions program. 

So we get about a week out and everyone's got their money and we're getting ready to go. We get the final itinerary for our ten-day trip and while looking it over I started to notice something seemed a bit off, although I couldn't put my finger on it. We are meeting every day at this point to rehearse the skits and things we'll be doing while we're over there. 

We get to SA and are picked up at the airport by the missionary, her ""assistant"" or ""head pastor"" in a big conversion van. We get to her place and let me tell you: it is nice. Not nice as in she's living like a queen or even maybe how we would think of really *nice* in America, but compared to these other people, her place is a palace. She's got running water, she's got tons of food, she's got extra space and tv and everything. Not too bad, I thought, this will be nice. 

Throughout our ten days, we didn't *do* anything. We didn't bring food. We didn't build anything. We didn't provide medical care. We didn't hardly break a sweat. We ate like kings. We were always full. We drove thirty miles one day to go to the MALL. To SHOP. For OURSELVES. We ate burgers and fries and coleslaw from an overpriced restaurant with the extra **spending money** that we had brought from extra donations. 

Let me tell you something about Tzaneen, South Africa, folks. There are poor people there. There are no poor people in America. Yeah, we have homeless, ""hungry"", etc. But there's always a place for shelter and resources for help. In many of the villages, there is one water well. That one water well gets water let to it from the city two times a week for two hours at a time. The entire village must share and collect as much water as they possibly can during this time for all of their drinking, bathing, etc. 

There is no readily available food. Many steal just to provide anything for their families. When the girls are old enough (young teens) they start to prostitute themselves to put food on the table. The living conditions are terrible. Imagine a cubicle at a bank. Double that, throw in some dirt floors, shoddy, weathered wooden walls, thatched roof with holes all over the place, and throw in a family of five: eldest brother (19) who works all week in the city and is never at home. Next four range in age from 5-17. Both daughters prostitute themselves. There is no bed. There is no regular source of food. Both parents have died from AIDS. All of the children have AIDS from their mother. 

Now imagine driving by in a van as big as their home, drinking water from a fucking bottle, complaining that it's too hot because the A/C is broken and you just happen to way 350 pounds (hellooooo, Pastor)! The motherfucking nerve. This is when I really started to notice things were off. Did we stop? Fuck, no. We saw one of the kids at service that night in their village, though. Of course we told them that God was great and provided for all of His children. Fuck that. 

Another day we were door-to-door witnessing. My team of four took a small village at the top of a ""mountain"" (read, big hill). It was about a half an hour walk up to the top. I met a lady in her mid-forties, in a tattered green shirt, long skirt cached with dirt, and a leapord-print headdress. She was dirty, smelly, and looked a type of sad that I could never begin to understand. It was my turn to witness. 

""Do you know about Jesus, miss? Do you know what a great and wonderful, kind and loving God I have come to tell you about?""... and it hit me like a hulk-fist to the stomach: What God is going to help this woman? What God is going to bring back the son that she hadn't seen or heard from in two weeks, who had been involved in the local gang activity? What God was going to provide her her next drink of water? No God was going to do these things for her.... 

I finished praying with her, because I didn't know what else to do. She accepted Christ, Hallelujah! Glory to His name! I felt... numb. We had been here for six days at this point and hadn't done a single real thing for anybody. 

""Alright, cn2092, we're headed back down. We should get moving before it gets too hot!"" 

I couldn't move. Here I was, holding two bottles of water for the *terribly difficult* journey I had embarked upon. I was wearing my favorite hat to shield my face because, God forbid I get sunburn! As the others were walking away, I turned around and found that lady. I told her in my English, without the translator, to take these bottles and this hat, and to take care and that I would keep her in my prayers. To my shame, this is the only thing I **did** the entire ten days I was in Africa. It was the only thing *any* of us **did**. 

We spent all that money, all that time, all that energy, to go on a fucking church tour and tell some of the poorest, most downtrodden people on Earth what a great God we served. How He was the ultimate provider, healer, and comforter. 

Before we left, I gave all of the clothes I had taken over except for what I was wearing home. I left the rest of my snacks and I bought as much water as I could with what spending money I had left.

A big part of me died over there. My faith did, for sure. My faith in people, my faith in the church, my faith in Christians, and my faith in God. 

Not sure why I typed all this out. I know nobody will read it; way too long. But I guess I needed to get it out - at least some of it, anyway. So much more I could rant on about. My heart still breaks to think of all that money wasted. $16,000. We could have built dozens of homes, schools, etc. We could have built wells. We could have provided so many meals for so many people. 

We did fucking nothing. 

**tl;dr: Sorry for all the text. Just ranting about a personal experience with missions. Spent ten days in Africa, did nothing, lost faith.**"

In the immortal words of /b/: ""Do it, faggot.""

It's a phrase that's been around for years, and it's become a mantra of sorts for many of us on the internet. Whether we use it as a way to motivate ourselves, or as a way to troll someone, it's become a part of our culture.

At first, it was just a way to encourage someone to do something. But it's taken on a whole new meaning in recent years, and has become a way to shame someone for not doing something.

It's a phrase that's been used in some rather unsavory ways, and it's something that we should be careful with. We should be careful to not use it as a way to bully or harass someone, but rather as a way to motivate and encourage.

Hey everyone!

If you're looking to connect with other photographers in your area, a great way to do it is to join a Facebook group specifically for local photographers. You can search for the group on Facebook, or use the search bar at the top of the page to find groups related to photography in your area.

Once you join the group, you can start connecting with other photographers in your area, share tips and advice, and even collaborate on projects. It's a great way to network and learn more about photography.

Good luck!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/photography with title ""look for a facebook group of photogs in your area.""","For me, I got my two second shooting gigs through a Facebook group of photogs.

It's not ideal as of course a ton of people want to shoot all the time, but it works occasionally.  
I love second shooting even when I have my own weddings too.  It's nice not to have all that pressure and just concentrate more on making good photos.  I also learn a lot each time.  Hoping to do a few more this year interspersed with my own weddings.

I recently heard a sermon about Plato's cave and the analogy of being in darkness but the light is coming. I was struck by how fitting it was to the Christian walk. We are in the darkness, but we have faith that the light is coming and that we will be with God. Beyond that, there's not much we can do but shrug. We can trust that God will take care of us and that He has a plan for us. He is the ultimate source of light and hope.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Christianity with title ""Plato's cave.

Not a clue.I don't think it's something that we can really grasp. The following is talking about the nature of God, but I think the same idea can be applied to the afterlife:

&gt;Let us suppose a mystical limpet, a sage among limpets, who (rapt in vision) catches a glimpse of what Man is like. In reporting it to his disciples, who have some vision themselves (though less than he) he will have to use many negatives. He will have to tell them that Man has no shell, is not attached to a rock, is not surrounded by water. And his disciples, having a little vision of their own to help them, do get some idea of Man. But then there comes erudite limpets, limpets who write histories of philosophy and give lectures on comparative religion, and who have never had any vision of their own. What they get out of the prophetic limpet's words is simply and solely the negatives. From these, uncorrected by any positive insight, they build up a picture of Man as a sort of amorphous jelly (he has no shell) existing nowhere in particular (he is not attached to a rock) and never taking nourishment (there is no water to drift it towards him). And having a traditional reverence for Man they conclude that to be a famished jelly in a dimensionless void is the supreme mode of existence, and reject as crude, materialistic superstition any doctrine which would attribute to Man a definite shape, a structure, and organs.

TL;DR, Plato's cave.

All I know is that it's supposed to be good, and that I'll be with God. Beyond that....*shrug* "

I recently looked into the Robin Hood Foundation, and I didn't find anything out of the ordinary. I read through their financial statements, looked at their investments, and read through their mission statement. Everything seemed to be in line with what a charitable foundation should be doing.

I was a bit surprised, as I had heard some rumors about the organization that were a bit concerning. But after doing my own research, I'm happy to say that everything seems to be above board.

EDIT: Fixed typos","give me the text of a reddit post from r/conspiracy with title ""Looked into the Robin Hood Foundation and didn't find anything out of the ordinary. 
 EDIT: fixed typos""","I'm big into primary research so I checked out the charity with the help of [this overview page]( The charity actually seems to be extremely transparent and garners high ratings. 

From there I dug deeper into the original financial documents when I discovered you can access their [_audited_ financials for 2011]( (with 2012 to come as soon as they're finished). In that document you can find that

&gt;Robin Hood’s Board of Directors, through their personal contributions, fund the 
unsponsored costs of events, all staff salaries and benefits, and all other non-personnel operating expenses.  
&gt;
Because Robin Hood’s Board of Directors pays all overhead costs, 100% of all unrestricted donations from the public go directly to organizations helping New Yorkers in need. 

So while there are a number of big, big CEO guys and their likes on the board of directors, this seems far from a financial play. I imagine the most uncouth thing they do is use it for charity tax write-offs.

With that in mind, I started digging through their investments in other funds (page 13).

Their largest investment ($7 million) is in the Brevan Howard Multi-Strategy Fund Ltd which is a massive hedge fund of over $2.3 billion (and part of the $27 billion Master Fund) but does not seem to have any direct connections to any board members. Elliott International Ltd is another hedge fund that I could not connect. The investment in the The Children’s Investment Fund lost money (which is appropriate). King Street Capital Ltd. is another giant hedge. My vetting became much less rigorous after this as it's a lot of information to dig through.

The one interesting investment was Viking Global Equities III Ltd. (held by Morgan Stanley Fund Services) which turned $674K into $4.2 million (provided I'm reading this right) though that seems to just be a $674K increase in the amount of funds they have previously invested. Apologies to those more financially savvy than myself who see errors in my interpretation.

Ultimately, the amount of money they are investing in these multi-billion dollar hedge funds (no more than $10 million into any of them) is nothing more than a drop in the financial budget and far less than the grants and direct donations the organization gives.

TL;DR Looked into the Robin Hood Foundation and didn't find anything out of the ordinary.

IF this is a conspiracy and it was some sort of inside job, WHY?

This is a question that has been asked many times in the conspiracy community and the answer is not always clear. It is possible that the motive behind the conspiracy could be anything from a political agenda to a financial gain. It could also be a combination of factors.

There could be evidence that suggests a particular motive, but it is often difficult to prove and is often circumstantial. It is also possible that the motive could be something completely different than what is being speculated.

The only way to truly know the motive behind a conspiracy is to look at the evidence and draw your own conclusions. Unfortunately, this is often difficult to do without access to the people and organizations behind the conspiracy.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/conspiracy with title ""IF this is a conspiracy and it was some sort of inside job, WHY?""","Forgive me if this is a stupid question, but I've been seeing a lot of Sandy Hook conspiracy posts, and what I've gathered is there's a lot of information supporting the theory that this wasn't just a freak accident. I've seen ""actors"" who are supposed to be the parents of the deceased, relief pages posted early, etc. etc. 

What am I supposed to make of it? I'm reading the information but it's getting jumbled in my head. What does it mean? Were all of those children ACTUALLY murdered? If so, where were the real parents and where did the kids come from? Was it all staged? Where does the use of actors come into play and why? 

WHY? Why would this be a conspiracy?, is my question. Don't take this as me trying to question that it IS one, I've seen plenty of info that says the shooting (and the Colorado one as well) were ""inside jobs"" I guess it would be called, can anyone explain WHY that would be? 

I know they're trying to instill fear, but for what purpose? I've seen stuff about FEMA camps, etc. The only thing I'VE gathered would be that these shootings were placed to alter the public mindset surrounding gun safety, but the public is SCREAMING ""BAN AUTOMATIC WEAPONS"". I feel like that would be the opposite of what they want from us. Is it to put armed officers around the country? Is it just to scare us?

This post is about the evolution of programming languages.

Programming languages have come a long way since their inception. What started as literal instructions of what to do with the machine have evolved into shorthand languages that are easier to use and understand. These languages can be used to create even shorter and simpler control languages, allowing us to easily control machines.

The evolution of programming languages is an interesting one, and it is amazing to see how far we have come in such a short amount of time. It is amazing to think that what started as literal instructions of what to do with the machine has now become a shorthand language that can be used to control machines easily.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/learnprogramming with title ""What starts as literal instructions of what to do with the machine, gain a shorthand langauge for controlling the machine more easily, and that shorthand language can be used to build even shorter, simpler control language.""","you're very close with your final question - the answer lies in how we got from hardware instructions to software instructions.

They started by telling the hardware what to do - set this valve to on, make this valve turn on/switch off when this one does, etc. 

Then they started building meaning into these hardware on/offs - so that off, on, off (010) represents the number 2; on, off, off (100) represents the number 4, etc.

Then they began to express some of these chunks of hardware logic as numerical and logic operations - adding numbers, finding the result of one number OR another, and now flipping a bunch of switches to represent a number could be thought of as ""storing a number""... 

Eventually, over time, more and more complicated numerical operations (which were really switch-flipping operations in hardware) got to be grouped together and represented by assembly language commands. 

And then modern programming languages were developed, which allowed us to write something much closer to English that could be converted to assembly language (and ultimately to hardware instructions).

To use an analogy, think about a modern car. You don't have to crank a handle to start it or manage the choke, or pump the brakes repeatedly to stop suddenly, because those things are now done automatically. At the start, the human had to understand the machine, and know about the engine, and tell the engine exactly what to do. Over time, these instructions could be automated and simplified so that the human can deal with the car in his terms - pressing ""start"" or turning the ignition without having to worry about starter motors or chokes for example. 

**tl;dr** What starts as literal instructions of what to do with the machine, gain a shorthand langauge for controlling the machine more easily, and that shorthand language can be used to build even shorter, simpler control language."

The Belgian Royal Family is one of the wealthiest in Europe. The King, Queen and their four children are estimated to be worth around €3.8 billion. 

Despite this, the Belgian government provides the royal family with an annual budget of around €50 million. This money is used to pay for the upkeep of palaces, salaries for staff, and other expenses.

I believe that the Belgian Royal Family should not receive any tax money. They are wealthy enough to support themselves, and the money could be put to better use elsewhere. 

Belgium has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with the government having to take drastic measures to protect the economy. It would be better to use the money that is currently being spent on the Royal Family to help those in need. 

What do you think? Should the Belgian Royal Family receive tax money or not?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/belgium with title ""the entire royal family shouldn't receive taxmoney they are rich enough.""","This is open for discussion, a 'dotatie' is taxmoney which is used for the normal functions of a member of the royal family.

Welcome to my post about paragraphs with a space separating them!

A paragraph is a group of related sentences that discuss a single topic. When writing a paragraph, it is important to leave a space between each paragraph. This helps to make your writing easier to read and understand.

When writing a longer document, such as an essay or report, it is also important to leave a space between each paragraph. This helps to break up the text and make it easier to read.

It is also important to remember that each paragraph should have its own topic. This helps to keep your writing focused and organized.

Finally, it is important to remember to proofread your writing. This will help to ensure that your paragraphs are properly spaced and that your writing is free from errors.

I hope this post has helped to explain the importance of leaving a space between paragraphs. Thanks for reading!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/leagueoflegends with title ""Paragraphs with a space separating them.""","Just looking at it right off the bat (didn't read through it but skimmed through) some format-like changes would make the guide much more appealing and easier to read.

Have you ever heard of the saying ""One man's trash is another man's treasure""? Well, that saying holds true for this story. 

Recently, a waste facility employee was sorting through a pile of trash when he felt a sharp pain in his hand. He had been stabbed by a needle! After a bit of investigation, it was discovered that the needle had been thrown in the trash by a customer. 

It's a good reminder to be careful with what you throw away. Even the tiniest of items can cause a lot of trouble if they end up in the wrong place. So, make sure to properly dispose of any hazardous materials and double check that nothing sharp is in the trash.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/WTF with title ""Throw a needle in the trash - it might end up in a waste facility employee's hand.""","In addition, when you throw needles away into the trash bin in California, AB 939 (I think that's the code) sends some of the trash to a recycling sorting facility in order to reclaim some of the materials.  In those sorting facilities, there are belts that move the trash past a line of workers that hand sort as much recycling from trash as possible.  Though they wear gloves, when needles are mixed in with the trash they can come flying out of the device that dispenses them quickly, impaling the workers hands.  Beyond causing obvious pain, this can spread blood borne pathogens the inflicted.

If you're looking for a great place to eat in Las Vegas, The Public House at the Venetian is definitely worth checking out.

The menu has something for everyone, from burgers to steaks to seafood. Plus, they have an extensive beer selection, so you can find something to quench your thirst.

Is there a time limit you're here for? A quick stalk of your username makes me think you are in Connecticut. I want to give you beer places but if you can't wait till tomorrow for the full write-up:

**Big Dog's Draft House**

**Ellis Island Casino and Brewery** (cheap beer, but GOOD cheap beer)

**The Public House** (In the Venetian. Don't get me started on the one in the Luxor.)

**Aces and Ales**

**Todd English's P.U.B.** in Crystals Mall at the City Center (it touches the Aria)&lt;---Note: Can you chug a beer in under 7 seconds? They'll let you have 1 pint free if you can. As I understand it, that applies to any beer you want, so have at it. Pro Tip: The beer can't leave the counter until the timer starts, but that doesn't mean your lips can't be hovering a millimeter over that sucker right before they let you start.

**Freakin' Frog**. I saw someone say service sucked/overpriced/Yard House has ""more"" beers. For me: Service has always been above excellent, especially on slower nights in the middle of the week when you can talk beer with the bartenders/no more overpriced then anywhere else on or near the strip/Yard House has more DRAFT beers. Freakin' Frog is home to 1,000 beers and has a literal Beer Bible (binder) for you to choose from. Ask them to let you check out their fridge, it's beautiful. If you like Whiskey at all, it is also home to the largest selection of Whiskey in North America upstairs and the owner (a professor at UNLV) gives a class on a tasting technique that is amazing. I'm not kidding. I don't like whiskey and this guy's technique made me like it. His class is like $70, but is great for groups and you get at least 7 shots (more if you ask nicely) of high quality whiskey so it kind of evens out. Go to the class sober, leave drunk.

I didn't mean to promote Freakin' Frog over any other place, I just thought it was weird people were so down on it. The *only* bad thing I can say about it is that it's a little divey. That's it. If you can handle divey go check it out. My personal favorite is the Public House in the Venetian. Call ahead and ask if Russell is around. He's the only certified Beer [Cicerone]( in Nevada and he is a great human being who truly loves beer. He's working on his Master Cicerone now and might already have it since the last time I talked to him was a couple of months ago. The food at The Public House is great too, but like the rest of The Strip it definitely gets pricey.

Some of those places are pricey, some not, but you said you wanted a good selection and I think these places are a little more unique then The Yard House. Yard House is great (I don't argue with anywhere that has 150 beers on tap), but you can find it in places other then Vegas. 

By the way, this wasn't my write up, but I love beer and got a little carried away. I'll send you the rest if I can find it.

It's been said that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but there is no meaningful evidence that an early breakfast is good for you. In fact, there is strong evidence that Intermittent Fasting (IF) is good for your body and brain. Studies have shown that IF can help with weight loss, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. So, if you're looking to improve your health, give IF a try!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/leangains with title ""There is no meaningful evidence that an early breakfast is good for you. There is strong evidence that IF is good for your body and brain.""","No. Just... no. Intermittent fasting may cause decreased overall blood sugar levels due to increased insulin sensitivity. However, there is no evidence that this will result in ""brain degeneration,"" and in fact, a great deal of evidence that IF, caloric restriction, and ketosis all confer neuroprotective benefits. The mechanisms for these neuroprotective effects are unclear, but based on current science, appear to be mediated through similar means, as IF, restriction, and ketosis all result in huge increases in insulin sensitivity. Neuroprotection has been demonstrated not only in correlational studies, but also experimental studies, which is certainly worth giving some added weight.

The studies which have shown correlations between breakfast-taking and glucose levels are massively confounded by conventional wisdom. That is, ""healthy"" people - those who eat right and exercise in general - might know that breakfast is good for you (because they have been told that all their lives), while unhealthy people might skip breakfast out of convenience. In any case, it's only correlation.

TL;DR: There is no meaningful evidence that an early breakfast is good for you. There is strong evidence that IF is good for your body and brain."

It's amazing how difficult it can be to follow two simple commands: ""Love God, love your neighbor."" We live in a world where people are so focused on themselves and their own interests that they forget to love their neighbor and to love God. We are so wrapped up in our own lives that we forget to take time to care for others, to show compassion and to put God first.

I recently ran a fantasy world circus campaign for my group and it was a lot of fun! The trick was to crank it up to 15 and make it truly memorable. We had all sorts of crazy acts and creatures, from a fire-breathing dragon to a troupe of acrobatic goblins. The players had to figure out how to keep the circus running and deal with the various challenges that arose. It was a great way to mix up the usual dungeon crawling and it really made the campaign stand out. So if you're looking for a unique and memorable experience, crank your fantasy world circus up to 15!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/rpg with title ""A fantasy world circus needs to be cranked to 15, because even 11 isn't that noteworthy.""","I only listed real life ones as kind of a stepping stone (it also didn't register in my head that he said DM). In a fantasy setting, you'd have more even more possibilities, but the idea of a Circus gets trickery to. The idea of entertaining a crowd with amazing displays of ability becomes less amazing if such things have the potential to be common place. 

Example: in real life, a lion tamer is amazing, because of the aspect of danger. If its a fantasy setting (DnD as prime example) and its a druid with a lion animal companion, the threat of danger diminishes and the act goes from fantastic to mundane.
If a magician made an acrobats net invisible to give the illusion of danger, and the crowd found out, they might feel cheated.
Even with no net, the acrobats illusion of danger is diminished thanks to the existence of healing spells or even a costly resurrection, should they fall.
To set audience at ease, I'd actually have center ring be an anti-magic field, to start.

TL;DR A fantasy world circus needs to be cranked to 15, because even 11 isn't that noteworthy."

""I think it's important to remember that you don't have to give up your Muggle things if you're a wizard. Sure, you may have to make some adjustments to your lifestyle, but you can still enjoy all the things you used to love. For example, I'm a big fan of video games, and I'm still able to play them even though I'm a wizard. I just have to be a little more careful with my magic when I'm playing. So don't feel like you have to give up all your Muggle hobbies and interests just because you're a wizard!""","give me the text of a reddit post from r/harrypotter with title ""You don't need to give up Muggle things if you're a Wizard.""","* Muggle history isn't wrong, it just doesn't include Wizarding history, and changes a few things (like witches escaping execution).
* Science doesn't cease to exist. Magic is a nice substitute, of course, but just because you can boil water with your wand that doesn't render a teapot useless. If anything, magic speeds up science and creates shortcuts. Potions is like Chemistry on steroids, there's many new reactions to learn!
* Math still matters when dealing with finances, measurements, etc. Math isn't that useful when you're an adult in the Muggle world either, depending on your occupation.
* The professors correcting your essays would still take off points for bad grammar, even if Hogwarts doesn't have a class on writing.
* You can still be a fireman. No one will stop you if you'd rather take on a Muggle occupation–hell, magic would probably make you a better fireman, because you could use the Aguamenti spell where the hose won't reach.

Here's a very, very long, completely made-up example of how a Muggle-born can have the best of both worlds.
&gt;Let's take Dean Thomas. While not *technically* Muggle-born (his birth father was secretly a wizard who left his wife and son for their safety during the first war), he might as well be. His mother, stepfather, and half-siblings are all Muggles. He grew up in the Muggle world, and had Muggle friends growing up.

&gt;At age 11, Dean finds out he's a wizard and starts attending Hogwarts. It takes some adjustment to learn to use a quill and relate to people like Ron who've never heard of football, but he's not the only person who grew up around Muggles. He uses a pen for his homework until he gets the hang of using a quill. As far as I know, there's no rule against it. Quills are just encouraged because they're the standard for wizards. Sure, it's a bit annoying being without modern conveniences like a telephone and electricity due to the magical interference at Hogwarts, but being able to use magic is a nice trade.

&gt;Every summer, Dean returns home. He plays video games and football with his Muggle friends, makes a baking soda volcano with his siblings, and he draws. He writes letters to his best friend Seamus with a pen on lined paper, and sends it via Muggle mail. Seamus writes back via owl, and Dean sends another letter home with the Finnegans' owl. He isn't allowed to use magic outside of school yet, but he still has fun.
Then he goes back to school, and the cycle continues until he graduates.

&gt;Dean considers becoming an Auror, but ultimately decides that his passion lies in art. He becomes a painter, with Muggle *and* Wizarding  clients. The only difference is magical portraits get the special enchantment to make them come alive, and Muggle portraits are motionless.

&gt;He marries Luna (BECAUSE I WANTED HIM TO, DAMMIT. I DON'T CARE IF IT ISN'T CANON) and they get a little house in Ottery St. Catchpole to be near Luna's father. It's an average Muggle house with electricity and a telephone line, because Dean needs to be able to contact his Muggle clients, and he has his Muggle friends over for tea every Sunday. He and Luna keep their ""magic"" things upstairs, away from their guests, but when they're alone they use magic to make household chores easier. They have the best of both worlds.

&gt;When they have children, they send them to the local Muggle primary school with a warning not to talk about magic with the other children. If necessary, Dean can cast a tongue-tying spell on his kids making it impossible for them to talk about magic around Muggles.

&gt;Dean writes letters to Seamus on lined paper, and Luna writes to Ginny on parchment.

I recently got a tattoo and I wanted to share my experience. I was a bit apprehensive at first because I had no idea what to expect, but I decided to go ahead and talk to the tattoo artist. They were really friendly and helpful, and they explained the whole process to me in detail. They also gave me some advice about how to take care of my new tattoo and what to expect during the healing process. It was really reassuring to have someone who knew what they were doing, and it made me feel a lot more comfortable with the whole experience. So if you're thinking about getting a tattoo, don't be afraid to talk to your tattoo artist - it's what they do!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/doctorwho with title ""Talk with your tattoo artist you're going to. It's what they do.""","I do hate to be a naysayer here, but seeing as what you're looking to use it for it's going to be quite difficult to find someone completely willing to do that for free. 
It's custom artwork. Used for a tattoo. Doesn't matter if it's just a few lines in a general box shape or not. Tattoos are personal.

Tattoo art is very customized to you, and odds are it's going to require revision to make it exactly what you want. And then it's going to go to the tattoo artist who is going to say the same thing and revise a little more so it works on your skin. I would advise talking to a tattoo artist. They may not be Whovian, but if you show them a picture of the TARDIS and a general idea, they can probably get you what you want. They're artists after all, it's in the name. It's what they do. And as you know, tattoos (good ones) aren't cheap. They're well worth it in quality, despite me having none, you can tell when something's been done meticulously. A tattoo artist uses skin and ink as their mediums of choice, whereas most artists you will find on reddit will be exclusively sticking with paper or a computer screen-an entirely different beast.

Had you left out the tattoo bit, I'm sure you would have had some more people pouncing on it to draw it. I certainly would have. But any time I've drawn flash art, it's not cheap for me (I'm not a digital artist), and even then it's probably got to be retooled by the tattoo artist because of sizing issues with what part of your body you want it on, and your own skin and what they feel will look best as it ages and heals. Especially with you wanting something minimalistic, not that line art tattoos aren't popular by any means, but nuances that happen with hand drawn, or even digital art, aren't going to be entirely possible with a tattoo and you'll still need to talk with them anyway to get it just right for you. 

I didn't mean to turn this into a long post-just kind of happened. I'm sorry!

**TL;DR**: Talk with your tattoo artist you're going to. It's what they do."

My head is all noodly trying to understand orbital dynamics in Kerbal Space Program. I'm trying to get the hang of it, but it's so difficult to comprehend. I'm not sure if I'm missing something or if I'm just not cut out for this kind of stuff. Has anyone else struggled with orbital dynamics in KSP? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/KerbalSpaceProgram with title ""Orbital dynamics makes my head all noodly.""","Think of it as being like 2 cars on a circular race track.

The car on the inside (closest to the planet) will move faster than the one on the outside.*

So, set your orbit to be about 2km less than your target and time your launch so that you are 100km or less behind. Once in circular, stable orbit, with careful use of the time speedup you will see the distance decrease. As you get close use low rocket thrust or RCS to adjust your orbit to get on an intercept path. This will mean raising your meters per second to match the object your chasing. At about 10km adjust your orbit so that you *lower* your relative (to the thing your chasing) velocity, otherwise you'll come in too hot and whoosh past. Or hit it, like I do...

I strongly recommend MechJeb and it Rendezvous module for learning what all the relevant numbers mean. You can see in real time what all of your control inputs do to your attempt at docking. When you get the hang of what's happening you might find that you don't need Mechjeb as much.

*Fun thing about orbital maneuvering is that to catch an orbiting object from behind you slow down (moving to a lower diameter orbit) and to let something catch up from behind you speed up (going to a higher diameter orbit). 

TL:DR - Orbital dynamics makes my head all noodly."

It's no secret that autistic people often excel in artistic and academic pursuits. Many of us have found success in these areas, and it's no surprise that med and high functioning autistic people do best when they are surrounded by like-minded individuals.

The key to success for autistic people is to find an environment that is conducive to their needs and interests. Artistic and academic communities provide a safe and supportive environment where autistic people can explore their interests and develop their skills.

These communities also provide a platform for autistic people to connect with others who share similar interests. This can be incredibly beneficial for autistic people, as it allows them to build relationships and learn to work with others.

At the same time, these communities also provide an opportunity for autistic people to learn from their peers. This can be a great way to gain insight into different perspectives and approaches to problem solving.

Overall, med and high functioning autistic people do best in artistic and academic communities. These communities can provide a safe and supportive environment for autistic people to grow and thrive.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/autism with title ""med and high functioning autistic people do best - and thrive - in artistic and academic communities.""","I don't know about that. There are tons of high functioning autistic people in my area (I live in an academic/artist/musician neighbourhood, lots of high functioning physicists, biochemists, musicians, artists, hackers, genuises around these parts, so common here that it's considered abnormal to be neurotypical).

If I have children I'm definitely going to make sure they're surrounded by artists and academia, it seems to be the most openminded community setting and because being kind of weird is socially acceptable here it enables us to function effectively.

I have issues with my circadian rhythm. Hormones. I'm way too sensitive. When I worked in the corporate world it was torture for me, the fluorescent lights, the smell of office chemicals, the almost robot-like (my apologies) stupidity of my coworkers, being looked down on even though I was one of the best workers in the office but I'm a bit weird. I hated it. I've lived in my current hood for almost 15 yrs now. I work for artists, film makers, in biotech, and hang out with likeminded people. They don't mind if I come in late, or stay up all night, if I say weird things, if I have opinions they don't quite understand, I don't have to wear restrictive suits or pantyhose anymore, I don't have to act or look normal, all I have to do is be myself, and be kind to people.

Like.. there's a guy, brilliant mathematician, total weirdo, high functioning autistic, who walks around in the dead of winter (-20C! damn cold) in socks and sandals, big winter coat, and a beard down to his belly. He is completely accepted by everyone in the community. I think he's hilarious. Doesn't like to talk to people but is a nice guy if you actually know him. He has a cute nickname I won't post here (sorry, just in case).

Anyway. If you are lucky enough to find your way in life, find a group of people who love and accept you for who you are, who enable you to live a full, happy life, who don't require you to ""adapt"" to a ""normal"" lifestyle, then you can thrive.

When I was a kid no one thought I'd make it. I was discouraged from going to college or university. I was told I wasn't *capable* of living a full, happy, productive life. I was constantly held back and put down. I wasn't even allowed to go to high school until they were sure I'd ""fit in"" (jerks!). I was a foster child so I had to deal with all that too.

I didn't listen to them. I moved out when I was 17. I got a job. I learned that as long as I was perfectly behaved at work I would be promoted and well compensated. I had temper tantrums the minute I walked in the door at home, but at work quiet as a mouse, I avoided conflict (to my own detriment).

In my early 20's I decided to try college. It was boring. The material was elementary. I switched from general studies to a history major to an urban planning major to a software development major (where I'm at now, really only in SD so I can pass the prereqs to qualify for a biophysics major). I'm at one of the most respected universities in the world. I have a lot of friends. I have a great resume with great references. I'm a total weirdo but somehow it works because I'm kind. And smart. And funny. Not to sound arrogant but to show... that self-love, self-respect is very important. And that it's possible to excel, to thrive, to be accepted, if you find the right community.

The only thing I needed to ""adapt"" about myself were the temper tantrums. That freaked people out, freaked friends and family out. It took 10 yrs to reprogram myself. Meditation is what did it for me. Breathing exercises. No medication (my body doesn't like meds). A bit of therapy that didn't help and only exacerbated the issue.

It's possible. If you're med or high functioning there is a lot of hope. For low functioning autistic people it's more complicated. But there's still a lot of hope. There's always hope.

TLDR: med and high functioning autistic people do best - and thrive - in artistic and academic communities."

So, to recap, opinions don't matter, facts do. 

It's easy to get caught up in the debates and discussions that happen on sports forums like this one. But at the end of the day, it's important to remember that opinions don't matter, facts do. 

It's easy to get caught up in the subjective opinions of others, but it's important to remember that the only thing that matters is the facts. Whether you agree with them or not, the facts are the only things that should be taken into consideration when forming an opinion or making a decision. 

So, let's make sure to keep the facts in mind and not get too caught up in the subjective opinions of others.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/nfl with title ""So to recap, opinions don't matter, facts do.

Peyton Manning has started and played 14 full seasons (not including 2011 when he was out all year) and until this past season played a guaranteed 9 games in a dome each year and another guaranteed 2 away games at warm weather stadiums for almost every year of his career. If he was better than Brady, you would expect his numbers to far and away surpass Brady's. Not the case however. Here's a side by side comparison of Manning and Brady through this current year and keep in mind that Brady has only started and played 11 full seasons (not including his rookie year or 2008 when he was injured) and all of them have been in an outdoor stadium in a cold weather climate while making away trips to Buffalo and New York as well.

Ave. TDs per season: 
Manning - 31.14
Brady - 30.36

Ave. INTs per season:
Manning - 14.92
Brady - 11.18

Ave. Yards per season:
Manning - 4,249
Brady - 4,073

Completion Percentage:
Manning - 65.2%
Brady - 63.7%

QB Rating Career:
Manning - 95.7
Brady - 96.6

Playoff Record: 
Manning- 9-11
Brady - 17-6

Super Bowl Wins/Appearances:
Manning - 1/2
Brady - 3/5

So, despite playing in a dome and warm weather for the vast majority of his games, Manning averages less than 1 more TD per season and nearly 4 more INTs per season than Brady and has a lower career QB rating.

Looking at the playoffs, Brady has made it to the AFC Championship game in 7 of his 11 seasons as a starter in the NFL. He's made it to 5 Super Bowls (and possibly a 6th) in those 11 seasons. Meanwhile, Peyton Manning has been one and done in the playoffs 8 times!

As a web developer, I often come across clients that don't address SEO in the requirements for their website. While SEO is important for a website, it has little to do with the development process if it hasn't been specifically addressed in the requirements. 

It's important to make sure that the website is coded in a way that is optimized for SEO, but it's not something that needs to be taken into consideration during the initial development process. The focus should be on creating a website that meets the requirements and looks the way the client wants it to. Once the website is built, then it can be optimized for SEO. 

If SEO is not addressed in the requirements, then it's best to leave it out of the development process and focus on creating a website that meets the client's needs. SEO can always be addressed later, once the website is built.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/webdev with title ""SEO has little to do with a development process when it hasn't been specifically addressed in the requirements.""","I assume the SEO aspect was never a topic with the ones who remade the website.

Should I make a guide for teaching Steam?

**Teaching Apples to Apples: 5 players**

Someone else was teaching it.  I smiled when I saw him explaining all the rules to the new players before even starting the game.   I thought it was interesting too when I suggested he be the judge first and he didn't announce or show the red cards given, and just picked one from his hand and said it.    How I always played it, is I would lay out the red cards one by one, saying them in some unique/quirky manner, and get table talk going.

Hey everyone, 

I recently came across a game I wanted to play, but it requires Java to run. I know that installing software on a work computer can be a tricky situation, so I wanted to ask if anyone has experience with this. 

Has anyone ever asked their IT guy at work if it's OK to install Java on their computer? If so, what was the outcome? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Today I learned a valuable lesson. I was at a party last night and I was feeling really down about myself. I was having a hard time talking to people and I felt like everyone was judging me. I was about to leave when my friend came up to me and said ""You're fine"". I was taken aback by his words and he just smiled and said it again.

It's not uncommon for relationships to face issues in the bedroom. If your girl won't put out, then it's important to find someone to talk to about it. Having a friend or family member who you can vent to can help you sort through your feelings and figure out how to best handle the situation. It's important to remember that it's not your fault, and that your partner's lack of interest in sex doesn't mean there's something wrong with you.

I recently heard someone say that TV is like showering a crowd with a fire hose, while the internet is like giving everyone a water bottle. 

It got me thinking about how different media can be used to reach different audiences. With TV, you can reach a lot of people at once, but the message is often watered down and is not tailored to the individual viewer. On the other hand, the internet allows you to target specific audiences with tailored content, but it's much harder to reach a large number of people. 

What do you think? Is this analogy accurate? How do you think TV and the internet compare when it comes to reaching audiences?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""TV is like showering a crowd with a fire hose, while the internet is like giving everyone a water bottle.""","TV doesn't know you exist, while the internet does. If you want to watch a web stream, you have to specifically request it from a server, and that server has to deliver it to you individually. With TV, you simply 'pick up' on a signal, and no-one is any the wiser. 

Because TV is essentially passive, it takes no more technology to broadcast to 20 or 20,000 people. With the internet, each individual viewer requires their own connection.

Funnily enough, Digital TV does 'load' in a way. Whereas in the old analog system, the video signal was simply demodulated and sent to the screen, digital tv data needs to be demodulated, demultiplexed and uncompressed before you see it, introducing a more significant time delay (which is why changing channels isn't as instant as it once was).

TL;DR: TV is like showering a crowd with a fire hose, while the internet is like giving everyone a water bottle."

Hey everyone! 

I'm sure many of us are trying to stay healthy while in school, and I've got a few tips that can help. At the very minimum, I can almost guarantee you will be healthier and lose fat if you: 

1. Eat better, eat less, drink more water and less sugary sodas. 
2. Exercise regularly, even if just a 30 min bike ride 4 times a week for the whole term. 

Everything beyond these minimums will improve results and let you 'customize' a bit. But don't go crazy. Eating nothing will likely kill you. Exercising 5 hours a day 9 days a week will likely affect your grades and space-time itself.

But we're ignoring that here as that won't get you in shape, just thin. Don't fret when it comes to tricks and methodologies that you hear lots about. Exercise is something that people can get quite ritualistic over. In reality, it's very simple science. It boils down to:

1. Eat less, eat healthier
2. Drink lots of water, avoid sodas and sugary drinks. Recent research even possibly suggests sugar-free sodas too.
3. Exercise REGULARLY.  Regularly. You can do it intensely or exhaustively but the important part is to do it regularly. Make it a habit.

Now, when it comes to what equipment to use, what programs to join up for, etc. that is all just to accomplish two goals. The first is to keep you coming back and not getting bored/lazy. Try new things, do it together with existing friends, or make new friends.  The second is to give you some choice over what you want to do.  Do you want to lose weight? Build muscle? Be able to jog somewhere without being winded after 10 seconds?  Do research, talk to people, and try things out to figure out what may be best for you.

Everyone's opinion is not equal.

In a society that values free speech and open dialogue, it can be difficult to accept that not everyone's opinion is equal. We are all entitled to our own opinions, but that doesn't mean that every opinion is correct or valid. Some opinions are based on facts, while others are based on personal beliefs or biases.

It is important to remember that opinions can be judged on the basis of accuracy, logic, and evidence, and that not all opinions are created equal. It is important to think critically about the opinions we encounter, and to recognize that some opinions are more valid than others.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/worldnews with title ""Everyone's opinion is not equal.""","Don't get me wrong, since you're not the only one by a long shot, but all you did was toss out a cliche to minimize the topic under discussion.

With all due respect, there is actually a huge amount of wrong with having opinions based upon faulty premises or complete ignorance. All you've got to do is visit Reddit for one day and you'll see a cajillion opinions on subjects where people haven't a clue or, worse, think they know something based upon what they'd previously heard or learned.  

As a matter of fact, I've about come to the conclusion that it's opinions--like yours--that have gotten us to where we are today (at least in the US of A).

If you'll indulge me, I'll explain. I submit that sometime in my lifetime there arose a notion of reporting he said, she said--i.e. let the viewers decide--implicitly endorsing the notion of everyone's got a right to an opinion, but the trouble is that people have a tendency of swallowing more readily something if they think they're getting it from a fount of wisdom, such as the media--whether it be the NYT, CNN or Fake Noise--a government figure, a corporate voice (lol), or even (quelle horror) an academic study or book. 

I trust most will admit that one or more of the above suspects are hardly credible all the time, if ever, but there are people like you who will sop something up as if it's manna from heaven and then go around spouting off as if you're now an expert and reply to someone, that's just your opinion, especially if that opinion rubs up against something you've previously held as true. It's why we're so dumb compared to our ancestors--don't get me started and tell me we're smarter.

If everything is an opinion, then there can never be synthesis, knowledge or (gasp) truth, which I'd contend is perhaps closer to the truth than you or I would be willing to admit, although it would tend to to corroborate my original point, which is that people go around spewing opinions on things they have no idea what they're talking about or utter absolute nonsense, but it's their opinion so we've got to let it pass unchecked, as you did, presuming it answers everything, when it answers nothing.

I'm sure you'll disagree and tell me your opinion.

When it comes to shopping for firewalls, there are three important factors to consider: functionality, cost, and ease of configuration. 

Functionality is key when it comes to choosing the right firewall for your needs. Make sure the firewall you choose can handle the traffic you need it to and has the features you need to ensure your network is secure. 

Cost is also an important factor. While it can be tempting to go with the cheapest option, it's important to make sure the firewall you choose is within your budget and offers the features you need. 

Finally, ease of configuration is important. Make sure the firewall you choose is easy to configure and manage. A firewall that is difficult to configure can cost you time and money in the long run. 

By taking the time to consider these three factors, you can make sure you choose the right firewall for your needs.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/networking with title ""When shopping for firewalls - look at the functionality, cost, and ease to configure.""","It looks like all he needs is a small branch office type of firewall.

Out of all of the above - the best for small business is a SRX due to cost; if money is not an issue then I would be looking into Check Point; if looking for Next-Gen features such as Application Firewall - then Mcafee, Sonicwall, and Check Point;

If VPN is a requirement then Cisco ASA, Mcafee, and Check Point (Policy Based VPN is configured under 5 clicks)

He gets so excited when the dog bus comes that he starts crying and runs right onto the bus and onto his seat.  My puppy is about 5 months old.

Like others have said, it depends on the specific place. The person who runs this day is amazing and can perfectly replicate dog noises.  On the first day,Rocko (my pup) barked a lot in the kennel. But Jill did dog noises at him (growling/scolding) and by day 2 he wasn't barking AT ALL!  She sends me picture and video texts throughout the day as well.

It looks like Mike Conley's slump is full-blown. He's been a starting point guard for a while now, but his recent performance has been far from stellar. He's shooting just 39.3% from the field and 28.5% from three-point range. He's averaging just 8.8 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 5.2 assists per game. His turnovers have also been up, at 3.9 per game. 

Conley has always been a solid point guard, but he's been far from a specialist. He's had to do a lot of the heavy lifting for the Memphis Grizzlies, and he's done it well.

Conley averaged less than 4.5 assists per game his first two seasons, when he was also averaging less than 30 min per game, and was still a teenager (he also only averaged less than 1 steal per game back then).  Ignoring those first two seasons, and looking at just the past 3 years when he was receiving 32-35+ min per game and had ""rounded into form"", he averages more than 6 assists and more than 2.5 rebounds per game.  Less than 3 assists and 1.5 rebounds per game lasting more than a week is more than a ""mini-slump"".

My point about ADP was a response to the idea that people only play Conley because of his steals prowess - ADPs that high are for glue players, not 1-stat-specials, and especially not 1-stat-specialists who don't even guarantee you a weekly/season win (Ibaka and Rondo, both widely viewed as specialists, can almost win blocks and assists single-handedly (pre-emergence of Sanders), which Conley cannot do for steals, and provide rebounding strength (Rondo is 2nd in the league in rebounds among PGs, Ibaka is 25th overall)).

If you must know, I got Conley in one of the last rounds of my draft, because of the way my league does keepers.

Not one where you've had to defend your country. Sure, you helped Korea and Vietnam with varying effectiveness, but those were expeditions into another people's land, and although the soldiers there faced hardship, they knew the military had their back and they had a home to go back to if they survived (and despite what you may have heard, their odds were actually quite good, in both Vietnam and WW2, about 2% of Americans who served in the war died, [source]( [source](

On the other hand, other countries, like the Netherlands *have* suffered an invasion from a serious army (not some puny Middle Eastern dictator or terrorist or whatever you guys are afraid of these days).

During WWII, our army fought and it was conquered. *AN ENTIRE ARMY OF A WESTERN, DEVELOPED NATION WAS CONQUERED BY A COMPLETE ARMY OF ANOTHER WESTERN, DEVELOPED NATION!*

I am writing that in caps, because I'm hoping you will read that slowly, read that again, and let it sink in. The army was conquered, the government surrendered *unconditionally*. There were plenty of Dutchmen with guns. But was a Dutchman with a gun going to beat the German army? No. Were a whole bunch of Dutch gun nuts joined together in a shooting/survival club going to beat the German army. No.

If a Dutch civilian tried to hinder/kill German soldiers with his own gun, do you think he would have stood a chance? I'll remind you again: *they defeated the entire professional, armed national army*. The scenario you are describing is more accurately called ""suicide by soldier"". Some did this. They died. Their guns were taken. Smarter Dutch tried to survive. If you had a gun, hide it, maybe get it to the resistance, maybe join the resistance. But that was also *incredibly dangerous* to not only yourself but anyone around you.

Did you know that during WWII about 3,5% of *the entire population* of the Netherlands was killed? Most of this was civilian deaths during the occupation. If the Germans were after you, you were almost certainly dead. If you fought hard against them when they came after you, you still had *no chance*. The only thing you might accomplish is pissing them off more. Which meant they would execute some family members, or maybe people from the same street as where you lived.

The arrogance, *THE ARROGANCE*, that someone whose army has never been defeated, a country whose civilians have *never* had to fear any kind of invasion whatsoever, let alone *experience* the fear and humiliation of a foreign army deciding who lives and dies, your life depending on the recalcitrancy of your neighbours and family members. 

That someone like you would try to explain to a European: *but what if your civilians had more guns?*

I can't imagine family members being executed in front of me. You know how I know this? Because I'm old enough to *have talked to people who have!* People who lived in the Netherlands during WWII. Who have seen friends and countrymen executed. And I will not have you disgrace their memory with your Fox News political bullshit.

It's amazing how people can be so judgmental about something as subjective as attraction. You don't choose who you're attracted to, and it's not something you can control. It's not something you can change, so why judge someone for something they have no control over? Seriously, it's not like people are going around choosing who they're attracted to like they're picking out a shirt or something. 

It's really disheartening to see people so quick to judge others for something they can't help. We all have our own preferences, and that's okay. We should be more accepting of people and their attractions, regardless of what they are.

If you're going to label every such person as being hateful, then good luck finding a partner, because your dating pool just got infinitely smaller.

Just because a dude doesn't want to date a woman with a penis, it doesn't make him a transphobe. Likewise, just because a dude *especially* wants to date a woman because she has a penis, it doesn't make him a transphobe.

It's often said that Japanese people don't play PC games because of the prevalence of handhelds, consoles, and porn. While it's true that the gaming industry in Japan is heavily focused on handhelds and consoles, it's not true that PC gaming is completely absent. In fact, PC gaming has a long history in Japan, and there are still many PC games that are popular today.

The reason why PC gaming isn't as popular in Japan as it is in the West is mainly due to the fact that most Japanese households don't have a PC. This is due to the high cost of PCs and the fact that most people prefer to use their phones and tablets for gaming. Additionally, the lack of a good broadband infrastructure in Japan means that online gaming is not as popular as it is in the West.

However, there are still many Japanese gamers who play PC games. One of the most popular genres is MMORPGs, with games like Final Fantasy XIV and Dragon Quest X being some of the most popular.

It seems that boxing, soccer, Formula 1, and handball are all struggling in the US television market. With the rise of streaming services, it's becoming increasingly difficult for these sports to find a place in the US television market. With the lack of exposure, it's no wonder why these sports are starting to struggle in the US.

Hopefully, with the help of streaming services, these sports can find a way to get more exposure in the US.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Boxing with title ""Looking at the us tv one could think boxing, soccer, formula 1or handball are dead/dying.""","Boxing faded in the us when most young athletes saw a better opportunity in football/basketball and college scholarships etc. The lack of serious us heavyweight means less us tv coverage too.

Hey everyone, 

I've been a boxing fan for a long time, and I know that it can be a difficult sport to understand. I've been in the same position as many of you, trying to make sense of the sport and the rules and the strategies. 

I get you. I understand the confusion and the frustration. I understand why it can be hard to get into the sport, and why it can be hard to stay interested. 

But I'm here to tell you that boxing is a great sport, and it's worth the effort to learn and understand it. With the right knowledge and understanding, you can really appreciate the beauty of the sport. 

So don't give up! There are plenty of resources out there to help you learn and understand the sport, and I'm sure you'll find yourself falling in love with boxing in no time. 

Thanks for reading, and good luck!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Boxing with title ""I get you.""","I hate that too.

We got issues.

As nurses, we have a lot of issues to deal with. From staffing shortages, to long shifts, to inadequate compensation, it seems like there's no end to the challenges we face. And on top of that, we have to deal with the daily stress of caring for patients and their families.

It's easy to get overwhelmed and discouraged by all of this, but it's important to remember that we're not alone. There are lots of other nurses out there who are dealing with the same issues, and together we can make a difference. We can advocate for better working conditions, better pay, and better patient care.

So let's take a stand and fight for what we deserve. We got issues, and it's time to do something about it.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/nursing with title ""we got issues.""","This is a well written post and I don't know your purpose so I'll try to address a few things.
FIRST: the work of Suzanne Gordon and a few others. She shows how everything from cost cutting to our portrayal in the media is hurting nursing. When I'm at home I can compile a book list.

1. The image of nursing: take a look at media portrayals of nursing. Most are foils or sidekicks to more interesting and important doctor characters. Medical shows show doctors doing things that are nursing responsibility that no doctor would ever do. Even the positive portrayals reinforce the ""angel of mercy"" image of our job... The emotional, sensitive, caring touch that is portrayed as intuitive to caring people, not involving skill or education. Have you ever seen a nurse leader? A nurse researcher? A CRNA or NP? A nurse expertly running a code? Nope. This reinforces to the public that we are sweet and caring, not technically skilled and highly educated.

2. Nursing's place in the healthcare team: we are both not respected for our expertise and expected to be jack of all trades.  We all know that in many places and environments medical education is slow to adopt a true teamwork attitude. I see no reason to harp on this. Many physicians see themselves not as a part of the team but supreme dictator. Many are not trained or encouraged to value or recognize our expertise. The good ones come to recognize this on their own.
At the same time, most of us have had the experience of needing to fill multiple roles. Because when there are staffing and budget cuts, it falls to nursing. No one to clean the rooms or stretchers? No social worker to arrange transport? No tech to stock your supplies? No NA or PCT to help feed or turn or check sugars? No phlebotomy? The answer is always the nurse. More and more *our role as the last line of patient advocacy is being manipulated to unsafely increase our workload and responsibility*.  Nurses are managing sicker and sicker patients and accepting more and more responsibility without necessarily giving up any to other healthcare team members.

3. The changing nature of health and illness in the county: the push to decrease he level of care with sicker and sicker patients leaves us taking care of more. The patients who would've been in the ICU for weeks are going to the floors sooner and sooner, and floors to home or nursing facilities sooner. It's a push to save money but it pushes high acuity onto people already at strained nurse to patient ratios.

4. The money push: nurses, especially good nurses, are not ""money makers"" for hospitals the way a good surgeon can be. They do not independently charge for services, and are viewed as a cost of running a facility. Therefore they are manipulated to ""maximum efficiency"" in terms of patient ratios and workload. However because the way maximum efficiency is measured is mostly by some rather arbitrary and certainly not all-encompassing metrics, administrators cannot be convinced of the value of decreasing patient ratios so RNs can give ""good care"". Also see above, the push is to put patients in lower acuity (read: less costly nursing care) as soon as possible without any costly adverse events.

5. Moral distress: this is a huge factor of burnout in many nurses. Most of us just really want to give good care to our patients. We could choose a more glamourous job, an easier one, a better paying one... But we really want to take care of our patients. However we are shackled and every turn. We have to fight to use our judgment and get a physician order for practically everything, even when we know better than them. We have to fight to keep even our wretched staffing ratios. We have to take over the jobs of other team members like techs and case managers when their jobs are slashed from the budget. We have to document and double document to make our employers covered from lawsuits (and ourselves) and to prove we are meeting core measures.  At the end of the day we often don't feel like we had enough time to do everything we wanted to do for our patients. Add to that the stress from difficult patients and the other problems listed and you see why people burn out. You get into the job to do the right thing and give excellent care, and you can't. Not because you don't have the skills, or the drive. It's the barriers put in your way, the other responsibilities pulling you in a million different directions. And it's WRONG and you KNOW IT. It hurts you that you couldn't be in the room with your comfort care patient and family but you had to prep your other patient and take them to the cath lab and you STILL stayed an hour late to finish your paperwork. It eventually burns your emotional reserve.

6. Nursing culture/a united nurse front: our infighting and problems are no secret. ""Eat your young"" culture in what is still a heavily apprenticeship based profession is our own poison pill. As listed, we have enough going against us, we need to stick together if we want to survive.  Additionally, as a profession we cannot even present a united front on our own education and standards. We can't agree on how to get into our field so how the heck can we present a united front to fight powerful organizations that are causing the problems I listed? A powerful, dominant physician culture? Highly profitable insurance companies? Corporation backed, money-first administration? As a profession we are challenged and what do we do? Complain about burned out old nurses, know-nothing new nurses, being forced to get a BSN, not getting with the times with an ADN. And physician dominance, insurance profits, healthcare facility corporations have been cashing in on our bitter infighting and probably watching with glee the fact that we can't get ourselves together enough to give them a fair fight.

I didn't cover everything, but I feel this gives a good overview of the issues we have.

Tl;dr: we got issues."

League of Legends is a global game, and it's no surprise that the Asian regions have been dominating for years. Even though other regions have been catching up, the Asian teams still remain the top dogs.

It's always a pleasure to watch the Asian teams play, with their high level of coordination and mechanics. They really make the game look easy and it's clear they take the game very seriously.

On the other hand, other regions have been struggling to keep up. It's almost like they don't take the game seriously enough and they often get stomped by the Asian teams. It's no wonder why the Asian teams remain at the top of the competitive scene.

If other regions want to compete with the Asian teams, they need to take the game more seriously and put in the hard work. Otherwise, they'll keep getting stomped like amateurs.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/leagueoflegends with title ""Love watching asians playing, other regions need to take the game serious or will keep getting stomped like amateurs.""","If its boring, don't watch.

The other regions seems to not take it too serious, they can make a living of streaming so they don't put too much effort on actually winning tournaments.

I recently had to have a tooth extracted and it was not a pleasant experience. I'm not sure why it was necessary, but it was an important procedure that had to be done.

This got me thinking about how often people neglect their teeth and how important it is to take care of them. We often forget that our teeth are one of the most important parts of our body and should not always be out of the question when it comes to our health.

It is so important to brush and floss regularly, and to make sure we are getting regular dental checkups. Not only will this help to keep our teeth healthy, but it can also help to prevent other health issues that can arise from poor dental hygiene.

So, next time you are considering skipping your dental checkup or brushing your teeth, remember that your teeth should not always be out of the question!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""teeth should not always be out of the question""","Female representative here.

Hi everyone,

I'm sure we can all agree that hormones can be a real pain sometimes. From mood swings to acne to cravings, hormones can really mess with us. So I wanted to hear your stories about how hormones have been whack for you! What crazy things have you experienced because of hormones?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""hormones be whack, yo""","Hormones and a release of tension can cause some crazy emotions in people. During sex, your body basically goes crazy hormonally, as everything just kind of prepares itself for the most important part of its existence - contributing to the gene pool. These floods of hormones can produce some interesting side effects, and any emotions you are keeping hidden or repressing can come out. Its often said that lovers bare their souls to each other, and I do believe this is one of the reasons why. 

My fiancee has had two interesting swings over the course of our relationship. The first happened after a really stressful two weeks on her end. Troubles with job politics, fights with family, and a host of other problems that she was bottling up. In the middle of the act, she started bawling like none other. I of course stopped immediately, and held her as she just cried and cried. She never knew exactly what she was crying about, but the feelings had just risen out of her during the passion of sex.

The second happened after a particularly good session. We had both been feeling good, and after one of her orgasms, she started laughing so hard she couldn't talk. We had to communicate over written notes for about a half hour until she could speak again. Never figured out why, but that session sticks in my mind as a interesting reverse of the usual emotional lows.

A bad partner will treat these emotional highs and lows as distractions, or worse, plow right through them and try to continue. As with everything else on life and love, good communication and empathy is the key.

Hey everyone,

I recently discovered a great way to make my clothes look great - baking soda and peroxide! I had some old t-shirts that were looking a bit dingy and decided to give this a try. I mixed a tablespoon of baking soda and a tablespoon of peroxide together and then soaked my shirts in the mixture for about 30 minutes. After that, I washed them as normal and was amazed at the results! The shirts were brighter and looked much newer.

I'm sure this isn't a new trick, but I thought I'd share it in case it helps anyone else out. Baking soda and peroxide = awesomeness!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/malefashionadvice with title ""Baking soda + peroxide = awesomeness.""","Okay, female here, but at least I'm from places with highs in the 100's F, and the prescription strength kind of deodorant isn't even enough on hot days.  So.  Here's my formula:

* About 2 Tbs baking soda (for one shirt)
* Enough peroxide to make a good, thick paste:  mix it up.  
* A bit of dish detergent (less than half a teaspoon; you're going to throw it in the washing machine with laundry detergent anyway)

Then use a cleaning brush (I use old toothbrushes for cleaning the mildew around bathroom faucets - use that one) to really rub the mixture into the armpit stain.  (Note that baking soda and peroxide are pretty much the active ingredients in Oxy Clean, so this is maybe just a cheaper version.)  Let it sit (overnight, preferably), then wash as usual.

You should smell ammonia just after applying if you get too close - this is a good sign that you have a nice chemical reaction going on, and you're removing the yellow from your shirt.  (And as others say, check colorfastness, blah blah - I just used this on white shirts.  But peroxide is ""color-safe bleach"", so usually you should be okay.)  Thanks to Pinterest for the idea, but I have tried it myself on my own shirts, and man, is it great.

After a 6 year break, I'm back to collecting Warhammer 40K miniatures!

Orks, 2000 Lizardmen, 500 Brettonians, Van Saar and Cawdor gangs, a Lizardmen blood bowl team.""","This is going to be a rambling post of my 40k history and armies so bear with me.

I got into 40k like this: One of my friends fathers was heavily invested into 40k/Fantasy- I'm talking 3000+ points of every army (painted and heavily converted to boot). Their entire basement was full of glass cases of armies. I believe he used to work in a GW store and as a Rogue Trader. Anyways, my friends and I were all fascinated by the models and so after some test games we each chose an army to play. 

I ended up choosing Tyranids (3rd ed) simply because I thought they looked cool. I racked up about 1500 points before realizing that I preferred shooty armies. I ended up repainting them several times, and lost a lot of the detail. My friend who originally started with Tau decided to switch to Eldar, and so I jumped on the opportunity to take up the Tau reigns. I decided to sell the the 'nids in 4th edition, with the intent to try out Ulthwe Eldar. I sold the 'nids for a good price to someone in Australia, but the post down under lost the package for 6 months. I had to refund the money, and was very close to receiving insurance money for more than I sold them for. However, the Australia post eventually located the package months later (which was now completely crushed, including all of my miniatures) and the person I sold it to returned it to me. USPS wouldn't pay anything for the damage, and I ended up reselling them at 30% of what I had originally sold them for.

With the 'nid money, I did buy an Eldar Battleforce and a Seer Council, but ended up not having the funds to expand them or any interest in battling with them. At this point I had actually begun several armies, none of which were completely painted. I decided I should refocus my efforts back into finishing my main, the Tau. I sold them and put the money towards the 4th ed Tau boxed army.

I am a Tau addict and ended up with probably 4000 points, maybe even 5000 or more (haven't done a total tally in years). I have so many Kroot that I also have a fully converted 1500pt Kroot Kindred army that I used to play for fun (back when Chapter Approved was around). Oddly enough the Kroot was the only army I finished since they were so easy to paint.

My brother liked the Space Marines, and so to get him into the game I basically went halfsies with him building (and painting) a Salamanders army when the Armageddon Codex came out. I have roughly 3000 points of them, with another 1000 points of unpainted SM that I'm not sure if I want to use to flush out the Sallies or convert them into more...

...Pre-Heresy Thousand sons. I have a small army of them, probably 1000, maybe 1500 if I load up on Wargear. I also have another 1000 points of post-heresy 1k Sons. I stripped the paint off them with the intent to repaint now that I'm more experienced. However they are currently on the backburner as I am (still) trying to finish my Tau.

I ended up being a pretty decent painter, and spent my free time in HS building/painting armies on commission. 40k: Crimson fists, CSM Khorne, IG, WHFB: Dwarves, Goblins. That means most of my personal armies were never finished. By the time I was heading to college (2006), my armies were still incomplete and I no longer had time to work on them. I brought them to school with me, but didn't even touch them. That was until this year, when I saw that 6th ed had just come out and bought the rulebook. Now I had time and disposable income and decided to get back into 40k with a college friend.

I got a little too excited, and since July I went ahead and bought another 1000 points of Tau, a 2000 point (unpainted) Eldar army, along with Ltd Ed Dark Vengeance and the 5th ed starter. I also bought a few hundred dollars worth of paints, and all of the current codexes (on ebay). I don't know what I was thinking, considering my other armies weren't even done. On top of that, I got a case of the WAAAGH and wanted to paint the 5th ed starter Orks first (as bad moons). I made myself commit to finishing the Orks before moving on to anything else. They're actually almost done!

Before my hiatus I also decided to experiment with Fantasy and have about 2000 points of Lizardmen, and maybe 500 points of Brettonians. I only ever played one game, and didn't really enjoy it as much as 40k. I also dabbled in the specialist games. I have a Van Saar gang, a small Cawdor gang, and a converted Lizardmen blood bowl team.

TL;DR Minus a 6 year hiatus, I've been collecting since 3rd edition. 4000-5000 points of Tau (not including 1500 points of Kroot Kindred), 3000 of Salamanders, 1000 of Pre-Heresy, 1000 of post-heresy 1k Sons, 2000 Ulthwe Eldar, 500(?)

As he has had sexual encounters with men ( that is, he sexually responded to men ), and we're assuming he has sex with a woman ( OP ), *this makes him bisexual in the context of this conversation*.

Yes, he determines his sexuality and the label he prefers. I support people being able to define themselves, but our grammar and word choice do not. I have many friends that are women that happen to have penises. When they go to the doctor, they are men, because at a biological and health level (AKA *the context*), they are men. I call them 'her', refer to them in the feminine, and accept their choice of labeling in the social and relative *contexts* because they are whatever they want to be *in that context*.

So, if that was sarcastic humorish trolling, kudos. You totally win, and I hope you enjoyed the snack.

If you were serious though, I think you need to get off your instant judgement high horse and think about the context and the definition of the situation in relevance to the OP's situation. Not every situation (*the context*) is the same, and we must be flexible in our understanding to be able to appropriately treat a situation with the best tools and language for the situation. By requiring or pushing everybody in all situations to use an absolute definition that fits best with the context of your life, you are actually hurting every situation that does not match the context of your life. In other words, the universe does not revolve around your preferences or belief systems, and don't tell me what word to use for anybody but you specifically. If OP had said what you just said, this response would not exist. But since a third party which cannot decide for OP or decide for OP's man or decide for me has decided to tell me what something is, **fuck you**. You are what's wrong with the sexual freedom movement.

**TL:DR;** I started my post framing that we were going to call him bisexual or gay (*HENCE THE ""BY DEFINITION*"", meaning, if you want to know what I mean, consult a fucking dictionary, kind of like what I just fucking did in this post) so that I would have a selection of different words with different connotations in the context so we can properly discuss the situation, you hyper-PC neo-sexist nazi asshole.

I had heard some strange stories about Bruce, but this one takes the cake. Apparently, when he was a kid, he got caught sniffing another man's ass. After that, he trained hard to make sure he never got caught again. I'm not sure what kind of training he did, but I'm guessing it involved a lot of running and hiding. Whatever it was, it must have worked, because I've never heard of him getting caught again.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/WTF with title ""Bruce trained hard after getting caught once sniffing man ass as a kid, vowing never to get caught again""""","Probably just one.

The man in front of him at check out bent down to get some change he dropped.  Little mystery butt sniffer man, lets just call him Bruce, standing there holding his mothers hand was fixated on this heavy set man ASS coming for his head.  At first he was scared, but Bruce watched dragon ball Z after school and thought to himself ""Goku never gets scared"" as that massive asian butt came towering down on him.  Instead of running like most kids behind mommy, Bruce, he just stepped up waiting for that butt to hit his face.  It was the smell that got him, the smell he'll never forget.  The sweet moment that dookie butt was going to hit Bruces face, that moment of contact Bruce was anticipating was instantly ruined by a slap to the back of his head by his mother.  That rage, as her eyes filled with tears when she looked at Bruce.  ""You're going to be just like your father!"", she yelled.   His heart sunk, he didn't understand, he just wanted to sniff that mans ass and didn't understand why his mother wouldn't let him.  Ever since that day, Bruce trained every moment he got vowing never to get caught again, doing what he loved to do, doing what he was born to do, sniffing man ass.  But even the best get defeated.

Recently I was looking for a gun that would pass the drop test, and I was told that a gun that can pass the drop test can be safely dropped on a rubber surface, but can still go off when dropped on a hard surface. This was a surprise to me, as I had always assumed that if a gun was designed to pass the drop test, it would be safe to drop on any surface.

It turns out that this isn't the case, and it's important to remember that even if a gun is designed to pass the drop test, it can still go off if dropped on a hard surface. So if you're looking for a gun that can pass the drop test, make sure you know what type of surface it can be dropped on safely.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/GunsAreCool with title ""A gun that passes the drop test can be safely dropped on a rubber surface, but can still go off when dropped on a hard surface.""","&gt;Drop Safety Requirement

 &gt;Requirements: The pistol is dropped from a height of 4 feet onto a
 1-inch-thick rubber mat, backed by concrete. The pistol will not fire
 (cartridge with a live primer, but no bullet) during the drop test. Each
 pistol is dropped from 7 different positions, with a different part of the
 pistol hitting the ground on each drop, for a total of 14 drops. Firing on
 any one of the 14 drops constitutes a failure for this test.

 &gt;Methodology: A magazine is fully loaded with ""dummy"" ammunition
 (live primers, no gunpowder or bullet), inserted into the pistol, and a
 round is chambered. The pistol is suspended in a normal firing position
 (barrel horizontal and parallel to the floor surface) from a ""cradle"" made
 of string, held by a compressed-air controlled vise mounted to a fixture
 whose height can be adjusted incrementally. The lowermost part of the
 pistol is raised to a height of 1.22 meters (4 feet) from the surface of the
 concrete-backed rubber mat. The pistol is dropped by releasing the jaws of
 the air vise. If the primer detonates when the pistol hits the mat, it is
 considered a failure. The test is repeated for each of the six remaining
 positions:

 &gt;o Upside down, barrel horizontal.

 &gt;o On grip, barrel vertical.

 &gt;o On muzzle, barrel vertical.

 &gt;o On left side, barrel horizontal.

 &gt;o On right side, barrel horizontal.

 &gt;o On the rearmost point of that device, if there is an exposed hammer or
 striker; otherwise, on the rearmost point of the pistol. Alternately, a
 weight equivalent to that of the pistol may be dropped onto the rearmost
 point.

 &gt;Firing of the primer on any drop constitutes failure of the test.

 &gt;Commentary: 
 A rubber mat is used in consideration of the fact that due to the number of
 different drop positions that are required to fully determine if there are
 any ""weak points"" in the pistol design that may cause inadvertent firing, it
 may be unrealistic and unreasonable to expect a single pistol to pass seven
 consecutive drops onto bare concrete.



tl;dr A gun that passes the drop test can be safely dropped on a rubber surface, but can still go off when dropped on a hard surface."

We live in an age of information, and it is becoming increasingly important to be able to back up our assertions with arguments and evidence. This isn't just applicable to theists, but to everyone. We should all strive to be able to support our claims with reliable sources and logical arguments.

The idea that atheism is given some special handicap in debate is a myth. Everyone must be able to back up their claims with arguments and evidence, regardless of their beliefs. The truth of an assertion is not dependent on one's religious or philosophical views, but on the quality of the argument and evidence that is presented.

Therefore, it is important to remember that everyone must back up their assertions with arguments and evidence. There is no cosmic debate coach who is giving a special handicap to atheism.

I'm often asked about my beliefs in regards to religion, and I've always struggled with how to accurately describe them. I've come to the conclusion that the best way to accurately describe my beliefs is to use the term ""agnostic"". 

I don't claim to know the answers to the big questions in life, such as whether or not there is a higher power, or what happens after death. I'm not sure if anyone can truly know the answers to these questions, and so I'm content to remain agnostic. 

I'm open to the possibility that there is a higher power, and I'm certainly willing to explore different spiritual paths. However, I'm not sure if any of these paths will lead me to a definitive answer to the big questions. So, I'm content to remain agnostic, and accept that I may never know the answers.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/philosophy with title ""The ""Agnostic"" qualifier is needed to accurately describe my belief.""","It's simply because I see the terms agnostic and atheist referring to different properties about my belief.

It's amazing how many people still don't realize that atheism is not a belief system, but rather the lack of belief in any gods or deities. It's not about having a problem with religion or any particular faith, it's about not believing in something that has no evidence to support it. So yes, there is a problem when people don't understand that atheism is simply the absence of belief in gods.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/atheism with title ""Yes, problem.""","The teachings of Islam do not entitle one to declare the teachings of Islam as law, or to establish their jurisdiction over neighborhoods.

This is a great way to manipulate the average last trades price on Diablo 3. I've been doing this for quite a while and it works like a charm. You list 1 commodity for 100g and instantly buy it from yourself. Do this as fast as possible until the average price goes down as much as half or more. Then you place small orders to gobble up the cheapies people just listed or anyone who panicked and lowered their price. The risk is even less than what you thought, and you can make a nice profit with this method.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Diablo with title ""Yes, this is happening nearly constantly but the risk to play is even less than what you thought.

The average last trades price is totally manipulated""","Absolutely, just like in the stock market whoever is a large player can become the ""market maker"" - where they control the price of the market by the action of buying, having, or selling the majority of the supply. This has been going on for some time with rapidly gaining popularity since you can make millions in just a few hours durring peak times. I'm going to fully disclose the trick knowing full well that hundreds more will start doing it, but its exactly that which will make the exploit stop being worth doing.

**Contrary to what others say it is not expensive at all and is as close to free gold as can be** You don't need to buy 10k tomes all at once to move the price around. What you do is you put up for sale 1 commodity (of anything, gem, tome, etc) at the lowest possible price (100g) , then you immediately buy 1 and... since you are the lowest price you buy it from yourself and regain your item. You lose 15 gold each time you do it for the commission which is absolutely nothing. You keep doing this as fast as possible and force the average price down. The net result is within a few minutes you can cut the average price in half. You then place small orders to gobble up the cheapies that people recently put up in the last few minutes at the new lower average price. As more people list at that lower average price it also helps lower the average trade price, and you fervently buy as much as you can. You time this to do it at peak times later in the night when you imagine people finishing their runs, selling and logging off. Often people just dump their mats at the average price the game recommends, which having been manipulated, is half or less of what everyone else is listing at. **the true fair price is the one that says last day of trades, where the one that says last 10 trades is heavily manipulated**

After manipulating the average trade price down you gobble up all the cheap stuff for example gems at 2543 then relist them at 5999 which is the actual fair market. You can also incite a fake buying rally, everyone sees gems are so cheap suddenly and place huge orders only to see that they win them at 5999 not the 3200 avg price.

You bought 100 gems for 3k each 5 minutes ago and instantly turned them around for double what you bought for. You just made 250k gold in about 5 minutes. Do this all day long til you have hundreds of millions, then sell the gold on the RMAH if you're a true free market capitolist or chinese. I imagine gold farmers are doing this now since its the fastest way to make gold and its rare I don't see any commodity being manipulated. **this is so not rare and happening the majority of the time** The more liquid and frequently bought the commodity is the easier it is to do. If you know that 1000 gems are going to be put up for sale in the next 30 minutes and you can lower the average price to make those people list it at a lower price, you are effectively naming your own price for the gems as the market maker and only you know their real value is much higher.  You can do it on perfect star gems too and bring them down 3-6 million or more but there are only a dozen or so trades by the end of the day, since its not as liquid you have to very patient and you risk just actually bringing the price down if you are unable to buy out all the cheaper ones to flip. Its a lot of patience for the 15 million gold you'll make but still relatively easy. 

Blizzard is aware of this and drastically increased the ""avg last day transactions"" a lot so its a higher average and less prone to manipulation but its still very easy to change any of this around if you are patient and persistently list at 100g and then buy from yourself... i'm afraid this will never stop until blizzard stops displaying the last trade average or raises that to the last 10,000 trades instead of 10. 

If you hate the idea of this, note that the real world financial markets work in the exact same way and how hedge funds make most of their money (the average stock is held for less than a few days, no one invests long anymore), and if it still makes you upset, you can fight back! Just buy 1 commodity at regular intervals (every 3-5 seconds) - if you time it right you can actually catch those 100g commodity items every time before the actual seller is able to buy them back. This is how you can get brimstone or star gems for 100g if you are able to ""catch"" the manipulation and take advantage of it by buying the item before the seller has a chance to buy it back. Start doing this anytime you see the average price fluctuating wildly and going down, that means a manipulator is at work!   Full disclosure, I saw the same thing going on and figured it out after I kept winning gems for 100g and wondered who would be so stupid to do that...then I realized whats happening. I never found any items worth more than 500k to sell on the AH so I tried it out - and turned 2 million gold into 20 million gold over a few days and then I got tired of it, its mindnumbingly borring but it can get you that upgrade you want which is just what I did. 

**TL;DR: Yes, this is happening nearly constantly but the risk to play is even less than what you thought.

Sports and drinking are definitely viable options, not just for things to occupy your time, but opportunities to meet other folks.
There's also incredible indoor rock climbing in Bricktown, outdoor activities like mountain biking, hiking, camping (although many of these require leaving and heading in almost any direction). 
There's a thriving art scene, tons of volunteer opportunities, lots of museums (Cowboy HoF fucking rules, Clown Museum, Nat'l Softball HoF, etc), several movie theaters and malls. Hell, even the zoo is great. Hot Air Ballooning? Archeology? Native American studies/culture? We got your ass covered.

Hey Summoners!

As someone who has been playing League of Legends for a while, I've noticed that a lot of players tend to stick to playing ADC as their main role. While ADC is definitely a fun role to play, it's also one of the most difficult roles to carry from.

My advice to all of you is to take some time to learn all the other roles in the game. Not only will this help you become a better player, but it will also give you a better understanding of the game overall. Learning all the roles will also give you more options in team compositions and will make you a more valuable asset to your team.

So, if you're an ADC main, take some time to learn all the other roles in the game. You won't regret it!

Thanks,

SummonerSchool","give me the text of a reddit post from r/summonerschool with title ""Learn all the roles, stop playing ADC so much because it's a difficult position to carry from.""","I recommend you start playing other roles.  I main ADs for most of my games since I play with friends in normals more often than I play solo queue, and it works great cause we can give each other feedback and we trust each other to make things work right.

But in solo queue, ADC is by far the hardest role to carry from.  Even support is easier imo (more on this in a minute).  As an ADC, positioning only gets you so far in a teamfight.  Eventually you will get dived by someone nasty or get chain CCed, and there isn't shit you can do about without help from your team.  But surprise!  Your team is trying to kill the support alistar instead of helping you, so you're dead.  ADC relies on the team more than any other role, and you can't count on solo-q players to peel for you.

Mid is the best lane to carry from.  Easy access to both top and bot as well as lane farm.  I play mordekaiser or kassadin if I end up mid depending on the enemy team.  Kass for the roaming or morde for the insane hyper-carry ability.

Jungle and top are sort of equal in carrying ability - it really depends on the champions involved.  Jungle's role is pretty obvious, but top should constantly be looking to roam into the enemy jungle or mid lane (don't forget wards) and set up with the team for dragons or other objectives.

Now, support can't carry the game (though if you know how to ward and use items correctly you are a major asset), but you can carry the lane.  A good solo-q support can make up for the shortcomings of the ADC and add to their strengths.  The support almost always sets up engagements, and is generally also the only one that allows for a disengagement if the enemy decides to chase.  Basically you can get kills for your adc, or prevent the enemy adc from getting kills.  You can save your teammate from fuck ups.  Your ADC cannot normally do the same for you.

Finally, I've never been convinced by the idea of learning to play just a handful of champs really well.  I did that for a while, and got good, but I branched out, and I feel that I do much better now because of it.  I can actually consider what kind of champions I'm playing against a pick a suitable champion for myself because I'm comfortable with such a wide variety.  I don't want to be stuck playing only graves when the enemy has caitlyn, or Kassadin when they have talon.

TL;DR: Learn all the roles, stop playing ADC so much because it's a difficult position to carry from."

Even within a transpo network there still have to be decisions.  My poor example, poor as it is, is a nice bad case example.  Not all roads are equally worthwhile.  If there's some method of assessing what benefit a specific road provides, we can decide which roads to build/maintain.

I'm a former martial arts instructor and I've seen a lot of people try to learn martial arts without proper instruction. It's not a good idea. I've seen people get hurt or even worse, hurt themselves because they didn't know the proper technique.

That's why I'm so impressed by this guy. He's doing it the right way. He's taking the time to learn the proper techniques and he's doing it so he doesn't hurt himself.

It's not easy, but it's worth it. If you're thinking about learning a martial art, make sure you find a qualified instructor who can teach you the right way.

Thanks for reading!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/woahdude with title ""he's doing it so he doesn't hurt himself.

This post is about Royce Gracie's dominance in the early days of the UFC. 

Royce Gracie's dominance in the early UFC events was due to the particular moment in history, not the inherent superiority of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ). Royce Gracie was the first to use BJJ in the UFC, and his style was a perfect fit for the rules of the time. He was able to use his grappling to outmaneuver his opponents and win by submission. 

However, as the sport of MMA evolved, the rules of the UFC changed and the fighters began to use a more well-rounded approach. This allowed for fighters of different styles to be successful in the UFC. As a result, Royce Gracie's dominance faded away as others began to use a variety of techniques to win. 

It is important to note that while Royce Gracie was the pioneer of BJJ in the UFC, his success was due to the particular moment in history, not the inherent superiority of BJJ. The UFC has since evolved to the point where fighters of different styles can be successful, and BJJ is no longer the dominant style it once was.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/woahdude with title ""Royce's dominance was due to his particular moment in history, not the inherent superiority of BJJ.""","BJJ definitely caused a revolution in America when Royce was fighting. But his amazing success was primarily because he was fighting people who had no idea what he was doing. He'd set them up for an arm bar and they wouldn't see it coming, and suddenly they were helpless. 

Contrast that to today. If you enter the ring and you're awesome *solely* at BJJ, a decent striker who knows how to counter takedowns and escape holds will win. 

TL;DR: Royce's dominance was due to his particular moment in history, not the inherent superiority of BJJ."

It's not uncommon for people to see a wild animal and think they can keep it as a pet, but please don't do that with a baby fox or wolf.

It's best to leave them in the wild where they belong.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/aww with title ""Please do not find a baby fox (or wolf) in the wild and think you can keep it as a pet.

You're probably wrong. I don't want to talk in absolutes since I'm basing this off one and a half experiments but in that russian fox experiment they had hundreds of subjects young and slightly older and not one of them was fit for a domesticated role until I believe it was EIGHT GENERATIONS of breeding the friendliest personality traits they could into these foxes. Also it is more of a vague memory but I remember a documentary in which a couple found or somehow got a hold of a wolf puppy and they decided to try and raise it with their dogs. It didn't work. Within a couple of months the wolf was exhibiting behavior which indicated it was unfit for a domesticated life. Although they treated it no different then their other dogs the wolf would not listen to them. It wouldn't even acknowledge that they were attempting to give it instructions at all. I don't believe it ever attacked them but if I remember correctly it began to become aggressive not just toward them but their other dogs which it had known since it was a puppy. Keep in mind wolves are, according to DNA markers, the ancient ancestor to all known dogs currently in existence. In short if these experiments are to be taken at face value it is straight up fact that although in humans nurture generally overcomes nature in foxes (and wolves) nature definitely plays a large role.

I recently got into auto detailing and I've been doing a lot of research on the best methods. One thing I've noticed is that if I hand wash, polish and wax all back to back, I start to get noodle arms towards the end. If I polish one day and wax the next, I don't get as tired.

If I have to break it up and polish one day and then wax the next, I don't get worn out. I prefer to do it all at once, but sometimes the weather won't let me because it's too cold out, or it starts raining, or the sun sets early, etc. This is where having a garage would come in handy for me! But I always wax after a polish.

It's not as bad as it sounds. I really enjoy working by hand so I don't really see it as a chore. Seeing my car all nice and shiny is always worth it in the end! Hope this helps you a little.

It's no secret that revolutions are often doomed to fail. We've seen it time and time again throughout history, and it's clear that the only way to make lasting change is to show that we can be better than what we are. 

We can't just fight our way to a better world. We need to be proactive and work together to create a better society. We need to be open to dialogue and compromise, and we need to recognize that there are no easy solutions. 

It's easy to make jokes about revolutions, but the truth is that these changes can be dangerous and even deadly. We need to take them seriously, and we need to be willing to put in the hard work and dedication required to make them successful. 

So let's not make light of revolutions. Let's show that we can be better and make lasting change. We can do this if we work together and approach the situation with an open mind.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/atheism with title ""fighting it will get us no where as it has shown in the past.

 p.s. I as so sorry this is so long I can imagine with my dyslectic grammar and spelling their are millions of problems with it I am very sorry.""","Yes but all your doing is lowering your self to their level. You need to show you are better then that to get respect, why the hell do you think the protestant church is more lenient then it ever has been. Not because people constantly attack it and call it out but because both sides are being respectful to each other and that grants them the ability to talk and to ease up on some rules but before that can happen one said needs to show they are capable of stepping down and talking to the other. Thought I do understand their are two possible outcomes to stepping down one is they do to and the other is total destruction but in the world we now live in such a move would be far to hasty for the church to pull and would only destroy their creditability in the process  so really we would still win in that situation apart from obsessively heavily segmented groups that put way to much faith in to such ideas. Yes their are always going to be idiots that stoup religious bullshit but and satire and jokes are good to help get past such things but first we need to show we aren't their enemy otherwise we only build on their hate we need to show that we can extend the olive branch by just maybe saying: 

""Hay I know some of your rules are outdated but without you none of awe modern rules and laws may never have gone in to place some admittedly bad but, most of which good and stuff the helped father humanity while still keeping control/peace (I know their have been allot of religious wars but allot of peace has also come of religion if you cant see that well then your blind and I'm sorry) in ways we just couldn't in the past so, I though that if maybe it would be nice if we stopped throwing shit at each other for no reason and had a talk about some of the rules that just don't work any more"" sure you might just get a ""FUCK OFF KID"" and if you do record it put it on the internet get some karma for it and watch the media eat it up but you might also get something productive out of all this fighting which would be better then more segregation, where large towns become atheist and small ones become Christiana because then things just get worse and worse. 

I don't expect you to agree with me here, I know it's hard but if we just keep fighting then we will do nothing but make the situation worse. I will go back to me last example the 1950-80 when black people first got real rights not imagine if instead of having MLK telling them to be respectful have him telling them to fight their white oppressors that would have made white people fear and hate them. Now that the situations and we are all traded equal now we can joke, we can have people make jokes and satire but for the time being we have a choose to make; we continue the cycle of hate or, we rise above it and brake it. 

One last point never in the history of the world has a revolution been a good thing. Even your american revolution was in essence a bad thing at first anyway, it was a war to make the rich free and the poor slaves nothing more that's why you needed to be a white male landowner to vote back when the deluration was first signed and even then their could have easily been behests and fixings due to the was the system used to work and still does to today. The same goes for almost ever revelation that has ever happened so before you get that idea you can just throw that out.  

tl;dr fighting it will get us no where as it has shown in the past. Revolutions a joke an should be seen as one in almost ever situation. For so many reasons more then I can ever give to you we need to show we can be better before we can start to poke fun.

""I miss my dog Shadow so much. He was my best friend for 12 years and he was always so loyal and loving. I still can't believe he's gone. He was so special to me and I will never forget him. I miss him every day. :(""","give me the text of a reddit post from r/aww with title ""I miss my dog Shadow :P""","How old is she man? lol This wasn't somewhere in Illinois was it? This brings back so many memories of a German Shepard I used to have when I was a kid. Her name was Shadow as well and was my favorite dog to this day. We only had her for about 2-3 years though and my dad ended up giving her to one of our friends who owned a farm.

We had a neighbor down the street who also had a dog. My dog, Shadow, and her dog, Melissa, became ""Best Friends"" and we would take Shadow to go play with Melissa often. Now our neighbor loved her dog as if it was a kid, she never had or was able to have any kids, so Melissa was her ""kid"". Anyway, it got to the point where our neighbor, who I will refer to as ""Nan"" would come and get Shadow from our house to go play with Melissa. At first we didn't mind, but then it got the point where Nan felt entitled to getting Shadow. Also, Shadow picked up tendencies of being afraid Thunderstorms which she never was from the beginning but Melissa was terrified of Thunderstorms/Fireworks so much that they had to tranquilize her during those events. I'm not sure if habits/fears can be picked up from other dogs. 

Now, as nice as ""Nan"" was at times she also had some problems, she was a bit of an alcoholic. Whenever there was a Thunderstorm Shadow would somehow manage to jump over our fence and ran to Nancy's house and there would be times were Shadow would ""run away"" this caused Nan to think we weren't treated Shadow right. It got to the point where Nancy called the Cops and would tell them that our dog ran away and gone to her house numerous times and that it was beginning to be a problem. 

My parents were very upset and mad at her because we thought Nan was our friend. Anyway, we later found out that all these times we thought Shadow was running away it was actually Nan who would come get Shadow and bring her to her house....

My dad didn't want anymore problems...So he gave Shadow to one of his friends who had some farmland and told my Brother and I that she was going to be happier there because she had all this room. Anyways, I was crying like a fucking baby for a 14 year old boy. Saying goodbye to my dog Shadow was one of the saddest things I ever had to do....I told my dad I wanted to see Shadow every week and then one day when we went back to the farm she wasn't there. :( She ran away. Worst fucking feeling ever man. I tried to look for her for hours but there was no hope. I was mad at my parents for a long time. 

Our dog played Soccer, Football, Basketball with us and even know how to open the backdoor for us when we were bringing in groceries. When we had our cousins over she was very protective of our swingset and wouldn't let them get near it, we had to keep her inside. And when we had a garage sale we had her out  for a while until she started barking at any kid who tried to grab our toys that were for sale. Who knew that a little fluffy fur of ball could turn into an amazing dog and friend. 

I haven't had another dog since then, but if I ever get a dog again it will be a German Shepard. Best dogs ever.

Sorry for the long storyl

TL;DR: I miss my dog Shadow :P "

It's been a while since I've played DotA2, but I remember that Keeper of the Light (Kotl) is a hero that relies heavily on his allies for mana. He can't keep their mana up until level 3 at the earliest, and since he lacks a stun, he will get trashed by 95% of trilanes. It's a waste of 3 heroes to go against a solo when 2 of them would fair just as well.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/DotA2 with title ""Kotl cannot keep his allies mana up until level 3 earliest and they have no stun, will get trashed by 95% of trilanes and is stupid to waste 3 against a solo when 2 of them would fair just as well.""","Ok i read the whole thing and my god I see no reason to ever run Kotl, Nyx and PL in a trilane like they said and here are the reasons why.

At level 1 you have mana burn which costs 130 mana, kotl which has chakra that returns only 75 mana, and lance on PL. At level 1 you can do absolutely nothing, and if the enemy goes on you can do absolutely nothing. They say you should mana burn early because of chakra but it takes 2 chakras to cast 1 mana burn, thats 50 of kotls mana, 38 seconds of cd for 1 mana burn...

Lets do a little theory craft here your trilane against a Lina, SD, Sven trilane. Anyone on your team gets disrupted they are dead you have no way to break the initation, you have 0 stun, 1 mana burn nuke which will not burn enough mana to stop the initiation and 1 slow nuke that do nothing whatsoever, if nyx got impale at 1 you would at least have a stun so your lane might not die repeatedly but since they want mana burn your trilane will get raped before kotl has illuminate.  

What is the point of putting nyx and pl in the same lane with kotl. Kotl can at best keep one of their mana up early game, not both and certainly not both while trying to keep his up enough to chakra both of them. This lane has very little kill potential, you cant even spam spells until kotl is at least level 3 which in a trilane that is not getting kills is like 7 mins in the game. 

To me its just a horrible horrible lane. Can someone please explain what im not understanding that makes this a good lane? I mean it could be decent against a solo laner but nyx kotl or nyx pl would do just as well without gimping themselves on levels. I just dont understand how or why this is considered a good trilane especially one they claim is good against other trilanes. It works on paper cuz on paper kotl is a ""mana battery"" and the other 2 are mana intensive so they have synergy but like i said early game kotl cannot sustain 2 heroes and certainly not 2 heroes plus himself so your stuck waiting till level 3. And if you wait till 3 at the earliest to start doing things with your trilane youve already lost. I just dont see this ever working in a real game against competent players.

TL:DR Kotl cannot keep his allies mana up until level 3 earliest and they have no stun, will get trashed by 95% of trilanes and is stupid to waste 3 against a solo when 2 of them would fair just as well."

Basically, when it comes to cutting corners in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, you can use your imagination. From reducing the amount of time spent on teaching and training to cutting back on the number of resources allocated to church activities, there are many ways the Church can save money while still providing a quality experience for its members. It's important to remember, however, that any cost-saving measures should be balanced with the incentives that the Church provides its members, such as spiritual growth, fellowship, and service opportunities.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/exmormon with title ""Basically use your imagination of any way the church can cut corners weighing for the incentives at hand.""","Basically cut corners when ever possible. Say a Scout Leader is doing some kind of mutual activity for the deacons/teachers. He's got 5 guys there doing the mutual activity. There is probably only 1 or 2 guys into it. They all do varying levels of said prerequisites for the actual merit badge. Maybe one go getter has actually done everything there is but most have half ass-ed the whole thing and are going to forget everything the next day just like school. The hour and a half are done and everyone gets signed off regardless of their level of participation. Then you have the BSA savvy ladies who can basically just call people drive over papers and you get your award to be handed out at the next court of honor. There were so many court of honors for eagle scouts at my ward that we were doubling and even tripling up for the awards. Pretty sure mine was with 2 other guys. Its frustrating for guys like me who go on 50 mile hikes and do more proactive things beyond simple church activities to get the special award. It doesn't feel very special or important when you and 3 other guys got it and you know at least one of them half assed it. I'm just a little bit bitter. If I want that on my resume, how do I know the boss looking it over is a sensible person aware of this fiasco or just another mormon who would appreciate it or anywhere in between.

Greetings fellow gamers! 

I'm sure many of you have heard of the classic fighting game, Mortal Kombat. But have you heard of its spiritual successor, Biblical Kombat?

Biblical Kombat is a 2D fighting game which pits characters from the Bible against each other in epic battles. The game features characters such as Adam, Eve, Noah, Abraham, and Moses, as well as some of the more mythical biblical characters like the Leviathan, Behemoth, and the Angel of Death. 

The gameplay is fast-paced and the graphics are surprisingly good for a 2D game. The characters are all well-animated and the backgrounds are detailed and colorful. The game also features a variety of special moves and combos that you can use to defeat your opponents. 

If you're looking for a fun and unique fighting game, I highly recommend checking out Biblical Kombat.

But don't just take my word for it - play both Sabian and whatever other brand you're considering and see which one you like better.

It's a common misconception that wealthy people ""don't pay taxes"" or that they use loopholes to avoid paying taxes. This is simply not true. In the United States, the top 1% of earners pay nearly 40% of all federal income taxes. The top 10% pay 70% of all federal income taxes. While it's true that wealthy individuals and corporations can take advantage of certain tax breaks and deductions, this does not mean they are not paying taxes. Tax avoidance is illegal and those who are caught doing it face serious consequences. In short, the myth that wealthy people don't pay taxes is just that - a myth.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/politics with title ""Dey dernt pay taxes"" is a myth.""","&gt;They cant pay taxes if they cant get legal documents.

This is completely false. The IRS will issue a taxpayer ID to anyone without a social security number. A US Citizen or illegal alien have the same legal obligations to pay income and payroll taxes.

I'm a big fan of the Mario games, and I've been playing them since I was a kid. I love the new 3DS games, but I can't help but feel like they're too easy.

""What did ants finally do that was good?

I recently read about a study that showed that ants can help reduce the spread of malaria. Ants are known to feed on the larvae of mosquitoes, which are the main carriers of malaria. By eating the larvae, ants help to reduce the number of adult mosquitoes that can spread the disease.

This is great news, as malaria is one of the leading causes of death in many parts of the world.

So I went on a vacation and was gone from my house for almost two weeks. When I get home I notice my room smells...funny.
I think, weird, maybe I had some dirty laundry that shouldn't have been left for two weeks and so I took my clothes out and washed them. I figure the smell won't go away immediately after I do my laundry, maybe a few hours or a day or two, sure.

I was wrong. The smell got worse. It started becoming unbearable. So I start sniffing everything in my room and throwing away anything I could part with that even hinted that it was the source of the smell. I tossed old hats, stuffed animals, etc., all while pumping a steady stream of febreeze into my room to combat the musky nasty mystery smell. I was not able to locate the source of the odor and just thought, ""fuck it, I have no clue what else to do, I guess I'll just leave my window open (which I often do anyways) and buy a lifetime supply of febreeze.

A day or two later I go up to my room and I notice a trail of ants coming in and marching across my wall behind my giant dresser. I hate ants and was ready to start an ant holocaust. I follow the trail behind my dresser and the source of the mystery smell is solved.

A DEAD FUCKING BIRD was behind my dresser. It was a small sparrow or something, but I put two and two together and realized my window was open during my vacation (cause I lived in a safe neighborhood on a culdasac and my room was on the second story), the bird must have flown in my room, smacked my wall, limped or fallen behind my dresser and died.

Hello everyone,

I recently had the opportunity to do some work in Cyprus and I was treated like an exhibit in a museum while I was there. People would come up to me and ask me questions about where I was from and what I was doing there. It was a strange experience, but I found it interesting to see how curious people were about me and my work.

Has anyone else had a similar experience? How did you handle it?

Thanks for your input.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/australia with title ""Doing work in Cyprus. Was treated as an exhibit in a museum.""","I'll admit up front that this didn't happen in Australia but it was a really strange experience and I thought it might fit.

I was doing some archaeological work in Cyprus and we were staying in a museum there. One afternoon after coming back from site we were sitting in a courtyard washing the dirt off of excavated pot sherds when a couple of busloads of German tourists showed up. It was kind of like being on display in a zoo, but there was no barrier to stop these people. For about 20 minutes it was just constant camera flashes (at 3 in the afternoon in summer mind you...) and pensioners literally fighting to be at the front. We were swarmed with old sweaty germans in fishing hats and bum-bags. I had people putting their cameras in front of my face and blocking my view of what I was working on just to get a better shot of honestly pretty drab, fragmentary ceramics. They wouldn't speak to us, we were just another exhibit to be marveled at.

I worked at a cafe in Australia for a few months, and we had a lot of South African patrons. Some of them were really nice, but others were just horrible. 

One time, a soccer mum nearly slapped me when I told her that we were out of her order. She got really angry and started screaming and shouting at me. I was so scared that I just backed away and she eventually left. 

Another time, I had a plate thrown at me by another woman when I told her that we were out of her order. She was so angry that she just picked up her plate and threw it at me. Luckily, it didn't hit me, but it was still a pretty scary experience. 

I'm glad that I'm no longer working at that cafe, but it's definitely something that I'll never forget.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/australia with title ""South African patrons at the cafe I worked at were pretty horrible at times. Nearly got slapped by a soccer mum, and had a plate thrown at me by another woman.""","When I worked as a waitress, the cafe had maybe 90% South African patronage. So they weren't tourists, but a lot of them were clearly very new to the country.
They treated all the waitstaff like absolute shit, especially when we were getting absolutely slammed on the weekend lunch shift. Some of the stupidest things they got angry about were: having been given sugar packets with their coffees insisting that I must take it away *now*, the fact we didn't have Ecco (some weird coffee like powder drink I had never seen before, or since - we got some eventually to stop the idiocy), and that they couldn't eat their take away in the sit down garden.

The worst two confrontations I ever had were as follows:

#1 Mother's Day was always one of our busiest and most booked out days. It was clearly explained to every customer at the time of their booking that they must be on time and could not stay any longer than the time they booked. One group of South African soccer mums had made a breakfast booking from 9:30 to 11:00. They had booked the largest possible table which sat 20 that was usually used for 4 separate tables, and arrived at 10:15am. They sat around for 30 minutes before ordering their coffees, and thankfully ordered their food at the same time as we had to get them out for the next booking. They got their food and drinks within 10 minutes (a hugely mad scramble for such a big table). Once we had cleared their table, we suggested they go to the adjacent park, that is when it got ugly. 3 of the mothers stood up screaming all at once that ""how dare we ask them to leave so soon"", by this time it was 11:20 and the next booking had arrived. They continued to scream when we explained to them *again* that they had only booked a time of 1hr30mins and they must vacate the table within that time. We had been kind enough to let them stay over, but they continued to scream, and began to target myself and another waitress as individuals. One tried to slap me, but I had my tray with me so she palm slapped wood. My boss then intervened, asked them again to leave before he called the police. All of this was in front of a number of other families, and their own children.

#2 Sunday morning and raining, so the garden was closed which made the inside of the cafe very tight and impossible to accommodate more than 20 people. A South African family comes in, I take the order for their breakfast and all is well. When I served them their food, the mother looks at her breakfast of bacon and eggs, then looks at me with the most horrific scowl ever. ""What the hell is this!"" pointing to her eggs. ""I ordered bacon and eggs, these eggs are runny! How could you serve me something like this"". I tried to politely explain that she didn't specify in her order that she didn't want runny eggs, and this is how they're cooked without special instruction. (now I understand the problem with runny eggs, i find them repulsive myself, but I always specify my preference when I eat out). She got so enraged that she stood up and threw her plate at me. I copped a plate to the head, and had egg all over my front. She stormed out of the place while I was standing there in shock, and the rest of the family followed her. 

I worked there for 4 years....

Not monetary, regulatory. There's a difference.

We often hear about the need for more regulation in the financial sector, but it's important to recognize that there is a difference between monetary and regulatory policy. Monetary policy is the policy of a central bank or other financial authority that sets the parameters for the money supply and interest rates, while regulatory policy is the set of laws and regulations that govern how financial institutions and markets operate.

The two are closely related, and both have a major impact on the economy. But it's important to understand the distinction between them and how they interact. Monetary policy is focused on controlling the money supply and interest rates, while regulatory policy focuses on protecting consumers and ensuring that financial institutions and markets operate in a fair and efficient manner.

In recent years, the focus has been on increasing regulation in the financial sector, but it's important to remember that monetary and regulatory policy are two sides of the same coin. Both are necessary to ensure a healthy and prosperous economy, and it's important to understand the differences between them.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/DepthHub with title ""Not monetary, regulatory. There's a difference.""","I totally just spent an hour composing a thorough, understandable, and disarmingly witty history of the mortgage meltdown, and exactly why it had nothing to do with monetary policy. Then while switching from a tab I was using for research, I backbuttoned it into oblivion. Ah, well.

The tl;dw (too long, didn't write) of it was this: the failure Bernanke is owning up to there is quite real, but it was a failure of the Fed's regulation mandate, not their responsibility for monetary policy. The boom was caused by bad paper being passed around the banking sector as assets, driving up demand for home-equity debt, and ultimately the price of homes. It was a bubble of inflation, caused not by the velocity of money (which is how interest rates are used control inflation), but by the misrepresentation of paper assets by a smallish number of cutthroat greedy bastards, and a much larger number of lazy and/or complacent folks under pressure to maintain a certain level of assets.

That having been said, inflation was on the high side in 2007; but the irrational exuberance in the mortgage sector was only a small part of that.  Most of the price increases came from sharp supply side shocks in energy, and (consequently) agriculture.  Overall demand was actually falling, and the big risk was stagflation, akin to the Carter era.  Increasing interest rates and slowing the economy doesn't help curb stagflation at all; it exacerbates it. Raising rates would've probably been about value-neutral in the mortgage sector specifically (fewer people taking out mortgages; but more demand for the puffed up Mortgage-backed securities and Credit-Default Swaps that were the real problem); but it would've done unequivocal harm to pretty much every other sector of the economy.

Also, while I'm confident I'm righter than you are on this, I may be wrong on some of this. I'm not an Economist, but I do read it on the can.

It's easy to get caught up in the idea that luck is the deciding factor in our lives. We may hear stories of people who have seemingly made it big overnight, and it can be tempting to think that luck is all it takes to get ahead. But the reality is that while luck can be a factor, it's usually hard work that makes it work for us. We have to put in the effort to make our dreams a reality, and luck can only take us so far. It's up to us to put in the work, and then luck can be the icing on the cake.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/atheism with title ""While luck is an element, most of us have to work hard to make it work for us.""","You seem to be marginalizing everyone that actually works hard for a good life. 

Of course all people that do well for themselves have had some degree of luck. For example; the luck of having the capacity to develop talent, the luck of not being on the street during the formative years, the luck of having good parents, etc...

However, most of us have to work hard to get where we are. I was teaching myself computer programming at the age of 8, started with BAISC, was doing Turbo C by the time I was 9 or so. I was lucky to have access to the computer lab at the university where my mother was studying for her masters and later PHD. We weren't rich, she was a single mom in a country we moved to together (US.) We lived in student housing, first in a studio, then in a one bedroom. When she got her PHD and got her first postdoc work we moved to a town home. Shortly after she bought me my own computer, because my she saw how much I loved everything about it.

I would say by the age of 12 I already knew exactly which business I wanted to be in. Through high school I worked on a lot of projects which got other people's attention. Eventually that early work and learning brought me together with a lot of amazing people and I built connections. By the time I got to university those connections made it possible to join a start-up, move across the country and eventually do my own business ventures.

This brings me to the point of 'connections'. There is nothing wrong with connections as long as there is no nepotism. Knowing the right person because they respect what you do and your skills, is a great thing. Through the years I've befriended people that know many of the exact same people I know, but they can't get anywhere regardless. I remember years ago I had one tell me ""I wish I had your connections"", but wtf... he knew all the same people, just had nothing to bring to the table.

Sure some people get by on luck, politics, backstabbing and nepotism. Most of us hate those guys and we hate that people employ them. Just recently I was in a meeting with a company I do business with. There was one guy with them that is exactly like that, total coat tail riding bro. It was so hilarious at dinner after, when we were discussing all the cool shit we did in our childhood, after university/college, etc.. and he was like ""oh yea I remember IRC, were you ever on dalnet?"" Mind you we were discussing things ranging from BBS, to who ran which IRC networks, hacked what, and which major start-ups people wound up at afterwards... Yea, virtually no one likes that guy.

TLDR: While luck is an element, most of us have to work hard to make it work for us.

If you have a huge party and order a bunch of shit and don't even leave a few bucks to a good server I mean your gonna look like an assbag to pretty much anyone omnipotent or not imo. Also, not paying them min. Wage is utter Norsedick.

As an atheist, it's hard to ignore the fact that the way we allow businesses to treat their employees in many countries has serious implications for the rest of us. We allow businesses to pay wages that are too low for people to live on, to not provide benefits, to not provide a safe and healthy work environment, and to not provide job security. This has real consequences for all of us.

Low wages mean that people can't afford basic necessities like housing and food, leading to increased poverty and inequality. Lack of benefits means that people are more likely to go without healthcare, leading to higher medical costs for everyone. Unsafe and unhealthy work environments can lead to more workplace accidents and illnesses, which can drive up insurance costs and reduce productivity. And lack of job security means that people are less likely to invest in their own education and training, leading to a less skilled workforce overall.

It's time that we recognize the consequences of our current system and take steps to ensure that businesses treat their employees fairly. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and to be paid a living wage. It's the only way to ensure a healthy and prosperous society for all.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/atheism with title ""Some of the legal ways that we allow businesses to treat their employees like serfs have actual negative consequences for the rest of us.""","Little known fact is that in most states, your employer only has to chip in to bring your wages up to minimum wage IF over the course of the pay period you make less. That's how I was literally paid less than my great great grandmother some days. 

Oh and the no benefits part also means no sick pay or short term disability. Sick cooks, bartenders and servers handle your food every day. I don't care how many times you wash your hands, one food service worker with the flu will infect others. Many of my employees (once I was promoted) used to hide illness symptoms to avoid being sent home when money was tight.

This post is about the tragic history of Jews in America and the unimaginable suffering they faced during the Nazi regime.

In the 1930s, Jews in Europe faced increasing persecution by the Nazi regime and many sought refuge in the United States. However, they were not welcomed in America and were sent back to Europe, where they were sent to Nazi concentration camps. Thousands of Jews were murdered in these camps and millions more were subjected to inhumane conditions.

This is a reminder of the horrific events of the Holocaust and the importance of standing up for human rights. We must never forget the suffering of the Jews and the other victims of the Nazi regime. We must also never forget that America once turned its back on those seeking refuge from persecution and violence.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/worldnews with title ""Jews went to america - but they were not welcome there and were sent back to die in NAZI concentration camps.""","        Morsi's aid is sooo wrong!

I think it's safe to say that there is a lot of evidence in support of evolution. There is a consensus among scientists that it's a valid theory, and it's been around for a long time. That said, it's important to remember that science is an ever-evolving field and new evidence can always come to light that challenges the current consensus. We have seen this in the past with theories being overturned or modified based on new evidence. So while I highly doubt that evolution will be completely overturned, it's important to remain open to new evidence that challenges the current consensus.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/DebateReligion with title ""I would highly doubt that something as well supported as evolution would be completely overturned.

&gt;It has always, ALWAYS been the person willing to confront the consensus that has revolutionized any field.

Well, how long does that usually take? How old is creationism? 80-120 years? And how much funding did it get in this time? Alone the creation museum cost 27 Million Dollars according to wikipedia. Wouldn't it have produced something convincing yet?

Are there really revolutions to expect in fields like biology in that one of the leading theories turns out to be completely false? Maybe some centuries and possibly several decades back when there was actually very little known at all about how the world works, but today with all the large scale modern science that has gone into it? Now the understanding of biology is actually decent enough to genetically engineer plants or grow new hearts from stem cells (well, nearly) and there are so many other fields that borrowed the ideas that have been found out in evolutionary biology. For example evolutionary programming / genetic algorithms. And the best thing: It works as well as expected.

Working from a desk isn't easy, and this one will remind you of that. 

I'm sure many of us have had the experience of working from a desk that is too small, too big, or just plain uncomfortable. I recently had the misfortune of having to work at a desk that was way too small for me. It was an old, wooden desk, and it was so small that I had to sit on the edge of the seat just to fit my laptop on it. 

The desk was very uncomfortable to work on. I had to constantly adjust my position to make sure I had enough space to type and use the mouse. It was also so small that I had to keep my arms close together so that I wouldn't knock anything over. 

The desk was also incredibly difficult to keep clean. Every time I moved my laptop, crumbs and dust would fly everywhere. I felt like I was constantly cleaning the desk, and it was really starting to get on my nerves. 

Working from a desk is never easy, and this one reminded me of that. It was too small, too uncomfortable, and too difficult to keep clean. I'm so glad that I'm now able to work from a much more comfortable and spacious desk.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""Seriosly, read this fucking thing, working from a desk is never easy, and this one will remind you of that""","Well, I'll tell you about my desk job. It's more of a standing job and painfully backbreaking but the pay is good, I guess. So, here we were, me and one of my colleagues, we used to have a cooking job. He brought me the ingredients, and I had this amazing recipe that most of our customers loved. The workspace was a bit cramped, but it was a side business, just us two. We worked on weekends and on weekdays. Over time, we became quite famous, but don't think that cooking was not a desk job, it had its fair share of boredom and panicks. Like once he caused a small fire and some other klutz mistakes that spoilt our produce. 

Anyway, fast forward, and my colleague had an accident. He was bedridden for quite some time. A corporate head then offered me a high earning job. I gladly took it up. The hours were flexible, the pay was pretty big. I could come in anytime and make the viand. It was well preserved and usually not served hot, so I did not necessarily remain in the office to make it all day long. But the requirements were massive, and the boss hated my previous colleague. My secretary was a pretty great guy and a kind of know it all. I had taken up this job full time by now. A few days went good enough, but then one problem arose. My colleague wanted to work with me, and I had no job to give him(I worked for someone else now, remember?). So, I asked my head  and he said sure, bring in your guy, just make him a better chef than yourself. But that was before I came to know that my recommendation had left my secretary unemployed, he was fired straightaway(Awkward eh). 

My age and some impulsive decisions made the boss consider firing me, but my work was astounding, so he took a cunning route and asked my previous secretary to take up my job. This was it, I had it. I asked my colleague to do something. Sometime later that night, I heard that the guy(secretary) had some accident, and I would be continuing. I was Godamn happy.

After a while, my college became good at his job, and I was getting old. Standing all day long, even with flexible hours were taking their toll on me. The head then asked my colleague to step up and replace me. I was furious to say the least, but you know how it is. 

He and my boss went on a foreign trip, where I thought the colleague will be joining a foreign affairs office, but I was mistaken since he came back. I asked my colleague whom I thought of as a casual friend by now to recommend the boss letting me continue, but he was just too detached after his sudden promotion.

I knew that I had to do something on my own to continue working at this workspace. I then went ask for help from someone my boss visited frequently and in the end, [bombing the godamn MOTHERFUCKER!](

Retain focus, answer more emails. Transition shift people leave, the large gray room falls silent accept for the clacking of key boards, I am now surrounded my my other 9 co workers. There is no escape. 

1:00 am: I get the first of my three QA grades from the client. My grade is shit. I will now not make any commission for this month. The client makes grammar nazis on reddit look like care bears. My paycheck has just been reduced by about $200-$400 by someone in a different state who I will never meet face to face and has never done the job I am doing. 

1:30 am: I NEED TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE. Take first of two 15 minute breaks. Sit in my car and day dream about how I would rob a bank or other various hypothetical scenarios. Smoke another cigarette.  

1:46 am: Bro boss asks why I am late coming back from break. Apologize, regain focus, more emails. Pray to the gods that you get hired at one of the other jobs you have applied for, there is no god. 

2:30 am: Boss is now asleep in a corner of the office (100s of cubicles). Me and coworkers talk about how retarded our customers are, this will go on for quite some time. 

3:30 am: Lunch. Go to 24/7 gas station, chug energy drink in car. Return to parking lot of the office, have another cigarette. 

4:00 am: Emails, more emails. By now all I can think about is leaving. Continue to banter with coworkers, most of them are ok but would never hang out with you outside of work. 

6:00 am: Productivity has ceased. Browse internet, go on last break, smile and knod at boss who has risen from the dead. 

7:00 am: Clock out, get in car, go home. 

7:15 am: Arrive home, pour scotch, sit on couch, fall asleep. 

4:30 pm: Prepare to repeat this process while applying for a new job.

With a few simple changes, you can make office work more enjoyable and productive. What tips do you have for making office work less drudgery?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""Office work doesn't have to be drudgery.""","I'll tell my story, just to give a counterpoint.

I work in an office in a developing country. I manage a project that works on improving working conditions in garments factories. My team goes out to factories and trains people. Occasionally we do workshops. So I organize those workshops, work on the content, go along on factory visits occasionally, write reports, do the accounting and oversight, monitor the garments sector and political developments in the country (affecting export industries).

Additionally, beyond the project, I look for funding from other donors. I also just set up a recycling project where we aim to increase the amount of waste recycled, to protect the environment and so that poor waste collectors can make more money.

I spend most of my time in an office, but I love it! I get to work on many different things, which keeps it interesting!

Hey Reddit,

I'm sure you probably all hate me. I've been a lurker for a while and I've seen some of the things people have said about me and it's not very nice. I'm sure you all have your reasons for disliking me, but I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. I'm sorry for whatever I've done to make you all hate me and I hope that one day you can forgive me.

Thanks,

Anonymous","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""you probably hate me""","Here's my job:

I get in at around 9:00-9:30.  The girl three chairs behind me is my boss, but she's new and we mainly talk about random shit.  In fact, this week I find out I'm reporting to someone else starting next week. Whatever.

Go online and open Google Docs where I write down all the stuff I want to do that day. I actually could decide to do nothing, but that's more boring than work.  I add a few items.  I think yesterdays items looked something like this: ""Figure out where to sit,"" ""Talk to our new CEO,"" ""build relationship with Steve ahead of project,"" ""figure out what causes our company's metric to be bad,"" ""put together presentation on last analysis I did.""  That's basically a day's work.

I then open Pandora and listen to music the rest of the day.  I do about half my work at my desk, and half my work on a couch.  My office has free everything - coffee, soda, chips, candy bars - and I drink / eat these often.  Thinking about where to sit is important because I have a new boss and I want to make sure I integrate myself in the team.  There's real thinking there, which is tiring, so I do that on the couch.  Next up, analysis.  I fire up excel and start pounding out a model.  I'm good at excel from my years of working in finance.  I'm genuinely curious to see the result.  1 hour later I have it - pretty mediocre correlation - nothing worth presenting. Bummer.

It's now 11:30 and I can smell the lunch in our company's kitchen.  I wonder what we're eating today.  I figure it's a good time to catch-up on some email and check gmail.  Nothing important so I go back to my to-do list.  I'm going to spend the next 15 minutes thinking about where I'll sit. The front is where all the engineers sit but I'm not one of them.  Hrm, let's move closer to them.  I put in my request to HR - I should hear back in a week.

It's now 12 and I go to the kitchen.  We ordered for a local restaurant - our favorite actually.  We all sit down and eat together.

It's now 12:30 and I forgot I have a meeting at 1pm to talk about our company's new initiative that my friend is leading on a new product we are launching.  I'm not leading it, so I'll help out but not much else.

It's now 1:30 and I go back to my desk and check my to-do list. Oh yea, ""Build relationship with Steve.""  I email Steve from engineering and say we should grab coffee soon. He emails back ""Sounds Good!"" and I schedule a time tomorrow for us to meet up.  

At this point, I have my weekly meeting with one of my two direct reports. I start off by asking him how things are going with the sales new vendor search and how's he's feeling.  He then updates me for the next few minutes.  Then I bring up a new project for him to focus on this week and what we want to learn.  He agrees and we part ways. It's now 3pm.

Time to pound out some real thinking. I position myself on the couch and work for 1.5 hours on tomorrow's presentation to the senior management about how we could save the company money by better leveraging our infrastructure.  It's a 15 page slide deck but I think it's convincing.  Satisfied - I fire up Google and check a few of the stocks I own.  No major change.  Ok - let's read reddit for 15 minutes.

Ok it's now 4:45 and things are winding down.  I look at my to-do list, ""Figure out why company metric is bad"" remains. It's too late to crank this out. It'll require too much thinking.  I check my email again and respond to things that have come in over the past week that I have starred in gmail.  It's now 5:15.  

""Bye everyone"" I say.  A bunch of people say bye and I go home. I make mid-six-figures for this job. Depressing or awesome - I don't know.

Salesmanship is one of the most important skills one can learn in life. It's a skill that can be used in almost any job, from sales to customer service to management. Yet, it's often overlooked and undervalued.

At the same time, support staff are often taken for granted. They are the unsung heroes of any organization, providing essential services that keep the business running smoothly. They often work long hours with little recognition and often have to deal with difficult customers.

It's time to give support staff the credit they deserve. They are the backbone of any organization and without them, it would be impossible to run a successful business. So, let's recognize the hard work and dedication of our support staff and show them some appreciation.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""salesmanship is of the greatest skills one can learn in life and at the same time support staff deserve more credit.""","^this.

Learning salesmanship is a life skill that will not only help your career, but your personal relationships and even personal growth (despite that most sales reps suck as people, but those aren't true sales cats anyways, they're the sociopaths who give us bad reputations because they can't seem to see past their commission check).

That being said, if the revenue makers didn't have the rest of you good folk to make sure our clients are happy... We would have nothing -of value- to sell!

If I can accomplish anything in my life, it's to help both parties more inherently recognize the symbiotic nature of their relationship.  Along with that recognition, better pay for those who excel at making clients happy, instead of it all just going to the guy who could care less if he promised the world to a client, without any responsibility for the fulfillment.

""Deflation, in its harmful sense, means the destruction of money, and this is not what happens with gold and Bitcoin. Deflation is when the value of a currency decreases over time, meaning that the same amount of money can buy more goods and services. This can be a problem because it discourages people from spending, leading to a decrease in economic activity. Gold and Bitcoin, however, are not subject to deflation because their values are determined by supply and demand, not by central banks. Therefore, their values can go up or down, but they won't be destroyed by deflation.""","give me the text of a reddit post from r/explainlikeimfive with title ""Deflation, in its harmful sense, means the destruction of money, and this is not what happens with gold and Bitcoin.""","First of all, you have a misunderstanding of deflation. Deflation in the original, rational sense of that word as a harmful economic phenomenon and a symptom of depressions, means a *decrease in the supply of money*. This can only happen in a fractional reserve banking system, since when such a bank goes under, checks written upon its reserves loose all value and money is effectively destroyed.

The increase in the value of money, in contrast, when it is caused by an *increase in the supply of goods*, and not a decrease in the supply of money, is not harmful. In fact, it is a great benefit to everyone in the economy. As long as improves one's own productive ability in proportion with the rise in the productivity of the economy as a whole, one's position is better off because, while one now earns $5 an hour instead of $10 an hour, this $5 now buys *more* goods than the $10 did, because of the increase in wealth.

Neither is such increase in the value of money (caused by increase in the supply of goods) beneficial to creditors and harmful to debtors. So long as those debtors continue to improve their productivity in proportion with the whole economy (i.e. if 5% more goods are produced, they themselves produce 5% more), the increase in the value of money will be matched by the increase in their wealth. It is only if they lag behind in productive ability that they lag behind in relative wealth, but this is as it should be because it transfers wealth to those who are improving their productive ability at a greater than proportional rate. (Incidentally, this is why farmers in the late 19th century U.S. agitated for inflation—they were debtors who were not keeping up with the economy's increases in productivity. Their being put of business is what allowed the country to move from an agrarian to an industrial economy.)

Debtors are only ruined by actual *deflation*—destruction of money—which, as I said, is caused by the failure of banks in a fractional reserve system. In such a situation, without there being any more goods, a $500 debt suddenly takes on a $1000 value, causing more banks to fail and potentially collapsing the whole fractional reserve system driving all debtors to bankruptcy.

(If you want to use the words ""deflation"" and ""inflation"" as many people do nowadays, to mean increases and decreases in the value of money, rather than the supply of money, you must then think about ""good deflation""—increases in value brought about by increases in the supply of goods—vs. ""bad deflation""—increases in value brought about by decreases in the supply of money. This is a conceptual disaster.)

Second, while there was a significant increase in the supply of gold resulting from such gold rushes, averaged over time it was much less than the inflation rate of the most responsible government today. Since gold is a commodity, it tends to be produced in greater quantities only insofar as everything else is produced in greater quantities, because of improvements in technology, resulting in a stable price. Nevertheless, I admit that this is an advantage Bitcoins have over gold.

Third, while a small number of Bitcoins may be accidentally lost, this rate would be very small if they were used enough to be extremely valuable and would not be a significant source of deflation. As I have already explained, the increase in their value caused by more goods being traded in a Bitcoin economy does not represent deflation. To the extent that it does affect people's spending patterns, it encourages saving—the investment of money in enterprises that will return more money than is put in—over consumption—the purchase of goods that do not pay for themselves. The effect of this is to increase the amount of wealth in the economy, which comes from production, not consumption.

Fourth, the actual total quantity of Bitcoins or of gold is *irrelevant*. 1 Bitcoin could power an economy of 3 people or 3 quadrillion people. This is because Bitcoins (and gold, through the use of paper/digital currency) can be subdivided indefinitely. (In the case of gold, I suppose, this would technically apply only down to the atomic level.) There is absolutely no need for the money to ""grow with its userbase"". All that must be done is that people move from trading in denominations of 1 Bitcoin, or 1/10 of one Bitcoin, to denominations of 1/1000 or 1/1,000,000 of one Bitcoin.

Of course, any currency's value will *not* be stable during a process of mass adoption or abandonment. If, for example, the U.S. government were to switch to a 100% reserve gold standard, backing all money with gold, its value would increase enormously. The same would happen to Bitcoin if even 1% of the global economy were to use it. But once such a currency finds its market value, prices will stabilize, and with Bitcoin will have a benign tendency to rise with increases in the supply of goods.

TL;DR: Deflation, in its harmful sense, means the destruction of money, and this is not what happens with gold and Bitcoin."

I've been a metal fan for years and I can honestly say that In Flames' Revelations is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. The combination of melodic leads, powerful riffs and emotionally charged lyrics make it an absolute masterpiece.

There's something so unique and special about Revelations that can't be matched by any other metal song.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Metal with title ""Revelations is the most beautiful song ever written, Still Life comes close""","Speaking of Piece of Mind, To Tame a Land has such a great intro.

Hey everyone,

I just wanted to share my thoughts on playing Lich as a support. The key to playing him is to not hit your own creeps at all, let the carry hero handle that. Instead, you want to sacrifice them for mana non-stop with your 3rd skill. You can then use your 1st skill to harass the enemy heroes. In this way, you act like a babysitter for your laning partner.

For your item build, I recommend getting Tranquil Boots (Green Boots) to help with your sustain. You will have infinite mana and you can buy a Mekansm for the AoE heal. That's it!

Hope this helps and good luck in your games!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/DotA2 with title ""go lich support for now,dont hit your creeps at all,let the carry hero do that (unless they are hitting your tower) ,just sacrifice them for mana non stop (3rd skill) and harass the enemy heroes with your 1st skill,so you act like a babysitter for your laning partner;go green boots (tranquil boots) and heal yourself if needed,you will have infinite mana,and buy a mechasm for the aoe heal,that's it.""","Imo you should stick with some easy supports for now like lich,lion and try to learn from your teammates or enemies (or just from the overall match),try and remember what skills the heroes have and what they can do with those.Dota (and all things for that matter) is basically a trial and error thing,you learn from your mistakes,but to not get flamed and all,try and learn from 1-2 mistakes.


Go from 2-3 heroes and add from that,i dont think all random is a good idea,you will get overwhelmed with information and nothing will stick in the long term.

Flaming and blaming in DotA2 is a common problem. It can be very discouraging for newer players, and it can make the game less enjoyable for everyone. That's why it's important to remember that flamers have absolutely no reason to flame/blame and you have all the reasons in the world to ignore them. Unless they are your friends and they're trying to help you improve, in which case you should happily oblige.

No one likes being flamed or blamed, and it can be very disheartening. But if you don't let it get to you, you can still have a great time playing DotA2. So don't let the flamers ruin your day, and remember that you have all the reasons in the world to ignore them.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/DotA2 with title ""Flamers have absolutely no reason to flame/blame and you have all the reasons in the world to ignore them.

If you lose, your team will be more than happy to find a scapegoat. 

If that happens to be you, regardless if you deserve it or not, just be aware thar you're not ""wasting their time"", because you aren't. If they feel like they're wasting their time by losing, it's their own fault for keep playing the game without a 100% winrate.

If they'll blame you for the loss, there are to was you can think of it. One would be that you're doing them a favor by keeping their delusion of being perfect alive, or that they're simply morons for blaming you for the loss.



Regardless of what you enjoy about this game, losing is part of it. If youo cannot accept that, you have problems, not the guy you accused of being the sole reason for the loss.

It's been a long time since I've been in the teaching profession, but I still love it. I'm passionate about helping students learn and grow and I'm constantly looking for new opportunities to do so. Unfortunately, sometimes it can be difficult to find a job that matches your enthusiasm. 

I've been in the same school for a few years now and I'm starting to feel like I'm in a bit of a rut. I'm still passionate about teaching, but I'm just not finding the same level of excitement that I used to. I'm starting to think that it might be time to look for a new job that will challenge me and give me the opportunity to grow. 

So, I'm reaching out to all the teachers out there to hear your experiences and advice. What do you do when you're feeling stuck in a job? How did you find a new job that matched your enthusiasm? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/Teachers with title ""Love my job; sometimes you have to find a new job; teachers vent here; find a job to match your enthusiasm.""","I love my job!  It's hard; I work long hours; and some days are really draining.  But most days are fun.  Many days have amazing moments.  I work with incredibly talented teachers who inspire me, and I love my principal.  I look forward to faculty meetings and professional development days because I know I am going to learn something new from my colleagues.  My students challenge me, inspire me, and some days make me want to run out the door screaming like a lunatic. I care about every student, from the straight A kid who always participates to the kid in the back with the hoodie and the attitude.  I have been teaching for 20 years.

Not every job I've had has been so rewarding, but I have been fortunate to change districts three times, and each move put me in a better situation. There have been times, especially early in my career, when I was extremely dissatisfied with a boss, or school policies, or my own performance.  I think most teachers' careers hit highs and lows, and we have to aspire to a level of professionalism: keeping the focus on the students, keeping the other b.s. outside the classroom, and knowing when we just need to find a new place to work.

Please don't get discouraged by what you read here. I think many redditors see this as a safe place post their opinions (and sometimes frustrations) to a group that can empathize.  My engineering and accounting friends just never understand the emotional investment I have in my work.  They don't quite get how a bad lesson can make me moody over dinner and how a cool new project can keep me babbling on all weekend about how excited I am. They most definitely do not want to hear about my awesome new rubric or how I totally modified tomorrow's assignment for the ELs. ;) Of course, I make them listen anyway.  But, it is nice to be able to share some stuff on /r/teachers that I might not tell anyone else.

Your post reminds me that there are many new teachers here, and I hope that nothing I post ever discourages a new, enthusiastic teacher.  We need you! When you look for a job, try to get a feel for the vibe at the school.  In as much as you have a choice where you will be hired, look for a match for your optimism, a place that values and nurtures enthusiasm and is willing to invest in the success of new teachers.

I'm not paying $100+ to prove I'm good at a game when I can prove the same thing online and keep that extra $100 for groceries, clothes, etc. I'm a competitive player and I'm sure I can prove my skill in other ways than shelling out a ton of money.

It's just that for some of us like Ryko and myself, that amount of money is a lot to throw down to take a gamble on.

So think about it this way:
Winter Brawl is going to run you like... $30 by train to get from New York to Philly, both ways in the best case. The Venue fee is $40. The entrance fee is $10. Then you have to consider housing/hotels and what not. That's going to run you about $20~30 to buy into someone's room if you're lucky.

So in the BEST case you're out $110 just to play in the PSABR tournament at Winter Brawl. And the payout will not in any sort of way cover your cost of travel unless you take first with at least like 24 teams playing in it...and the profit line then is very minimal.

It's not like Marvel where winning is a few hundred/thousand dollars and you get all the swag prizing on top of it like a stick/headphones. This is basically a side tournament for a game that isn't going to have a lot of entrants. 

You basically are by default a pot monster unless you know for sure a large amount of people are going and you are fairly sure you can beat every last one of them. That's fine. Whatever... just for two working adults, the time and effort isn't compensated enough.

It's amazing how some 14 year olds these days think they can get whatever they want. I recently had an experience with a spoiled 14 year old who thought he was entitled to everything and threw a temper tantrum when he didn't get it. I understand that children should be given certain luxuries, but this kid had no concept of the value of money or the importance of earning it himself. He had no concept of delayed gratification and was completely oblivious to the fact that his parents had to work hard to give him the things he had. This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable and it's no wonder why so many people think that spoiled 14 year olds are the worst people in the world.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/personalfinance with title ""spoiled 14 year olds are the worst people in the world.""","RECAP: 14 or 15 year old OP gave about $3000 of savings (allowance money from parents) to ""day trader"" dad to invest and they didn't have any understanding of what they were investing in.

A recent study published in the journal Nature Communications has found a link between high levels of sugar in the brain and the accumulation of a protein called amyloid-beta, which is associated with Alzheimer's disease. The study, conducted by researchers at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, found that when sugar levels increased in the brain, the protein amyloid-beta attached itself faster. This could potentially explain why people with diabetes are at greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

It's been a while since we've seen any real innovation in the competitive League of Legends scene. Sure, there have been some small changes, but nothing that has really changed the game in any meaningful way.

Personally I'd rather not have it rushed just because people think it's unfair that the pro scene is currently fully male. Rushing things could (keyword: *could* ) result in having someone who isn't as dedicated to playing, lets down their team and/or gets the community into a position of thinking that girls can't play at a pro level.

SCG (StarCityGames) is one of the best online Magic: The Gathering retailers around. They offer a wide selection of cards, supplies, and other products for MTG players. They also have the best customer service department of any online MTG retailer. They always respond quickly to inquiries, and they go above and beyond to make sure their customers are satisfied. 

SCG is a business, and like any business, they are designed to make a profit. However, they are also dedicated to providing the best customer service possible. They strive to make sure their customers are satisfied and that their orders are filled quickly and accurately. 

If you're looking for a reliable and trustworthy online MTG retailer, SCG is definitely the way to go. Their customer service is top notch, and their selection of products is second to none.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/magicTCG with title ""SCG is a business designed to make a profit and probably has the best customer service department of any online MTG retailer.""","I just want to say a few things here. SCG has handled each of the issues you've highlighted almost exactly as you would expect a business to handle them:

""Banning other vendors from their event to corner the market.""

I don't understand how you could consider this them banning other vendors from their personal events. They put out all of the money for things such as venues, prizes, and staffing. Why are they under some mandate to allow other vendors at their events? The other large-market retailers could run their own tournament series and be the only vendor. SCG is just the only site whose decided to do it (TCGPlayer hosts a collection of vendors much like their website's model).

""Rampant cheating among their top players.""

The most notorious of these issues have been events surrounding Alex Bertoncini, Edgar Flores, and that guy who drew the batterskull from the bottom of his deck. Bertoncini is still serving the remainder of his 18-month ban. Elden (Batterskull man) is still serving his 18-month suspension. Flores served a 6 month suspension in 2012 and has come back recently to T4 a Grand Prix. What more do you want from them other than to catch the cheaters that they can and punish them accordingly? Actually, how can you even fault SCG for people cheating in their events? That isn't in their control and it is going to happen in every facet of competitive play.

""Canceling people's orders when prices go up.""

Do you have some hard proof of this happening to you? Because I have proof of the opposite. Back when Valakut was unbanned in Modern I ordered 8 copies of each Prismatic Omen @ 3.49 each and Wargate @ 0.75 each. I attempted to use Paypal to finalize the payment, but after an error in paypal processing, the cards we're removed from their inventory and I thought I was just boned. I received a call 3 days later while in Atlanta for the SCG Invitational (I live in Philadelphia) from their customer service department asking if i still wanted the cards at the price they had been advertised at. I gave them a CC over the phone and got my cards within a week. 

I will say a friend of mine did have an order canceled for Second Sunrise after PT RTR. Ben Bleiweiss (Basically SCGs #2) came out and said that the order was mishandled from how they normally treat things like this. My friend received his cards shortly afterwards. Read it all here: 

""Shady judge calls at their events.""

I've been playing competitively for about 7-8 years now. After playing in about 10 SCG Open events over the past few years, I have noticed nothing ""shady"" about rulings given during these events. Sure, every once in a while, judges get things wrong. I've seen bad rulings happen at all levels of the game, and it is just a part of the game when it comes down to it. I can't say for certain whether ""shady"" stuff goes down or not, but I know I haven't seen it. I would also believe the onus is on the accuser to cite specific examples when throwing around accusations like this.

TL;DR: SCG is a business designed to make a profit and probably has the best customer service department of any online MTG retailer."

""Hey everyone,

So I've been married for a few years now and for the past two Valentine's Days, I haven't been able to meet my wife's expectations.

Now I'm afraid of another fight this year, so I'm thinking of asking her if we can just not celebrate Valentine's Day this year.

Do you think this is a good idea? Do you have any other suggestions for how I can avoid another fight this year?

The last two Valentines were completely awful.   Two years ago, my wife really didn’t like the gift I gave her, and was pretty much a bitch about it.   Part of the problem is that she gave me my present with breakfast that morning.  I didn’t have her gift ready first thing Monday morning which was a mistake.    

I had picked out a ring for her from Kohl’s.  Kohl’s sometimes give you ‘coupons’ that act as cash but are only good for a specific week.    I bought something else at the store on Friday, got my $20 coupon, which I wouldn’t be able to use until the next week.   So I decided to wait until Monday (Valentine’s day) to pick up her gift to give her that night when I got home from work.   I got blamed for ‘not caring’ and ‘you forgot and tried to make it up’ and etc.   I really was just trying to save a little money and figured Valentine’s night was more appropriate anyway.

Skip forward a year, she leaves my present in the seat of my car (again first thing on Valentine’s morning).   When I got to work, I didn’t call her through the day to thank her for my gift or tell her what I thought about it.   This was a mistake on my part.   Before I even got home from work I had already been bitched out again for being insensitive. 
I am going to tell her that I don’t even want to celebrate Valentine’s this year.   I get her flowers and other little presents when I feel like it for no reason at all.  I hate being ‘forced’ to find something to give for this stupid day.   It means more when it’s spontaneous anyway, IMO.

Then there's your short $510 call. If at some time between now and 2015 AAPL goes to $600 or something, and the holder calls your shares away early - you owe him 100 shares or $51,000. You can buy them from the market for $60,000, fill the guy's call, and hold on to your $300 call which is a nice position to be in, only being able to make risk-free money - but that requires that you have $60,000 that you can simply throw in.

""I recently had a conversation with a religious person who tried to explain why they believed in God. Their explanation was basically that God is the reason why everything exists, and that God is the source of all life.

I have to say, this explanation was really unsatisfying to me. It doesn't explain anything at all. It's just a statement that has no real meaning. It's like saying ""The sky is blue because it's blue"". It's balderdash.

What do you think? Do you think this explanation is satisfactory, or do you think it's balderdash too?""","give me the text of a reddit post from r/atheism with title ""Because it's balderdash. Explains nothing at all.""","&gt;Here's the basics: my view is that an underlying force/energy allows the universe's physical properties to exist and function.

If by this you mean we do not yet fully understand the strong and weak nuclear forces, electromagnetism, and gravity and how they unify in enough detail to create a Grand Unified Theory, then I'd agree with you. With the exception of gravity however, we do have an approximation of their interactions as described by perturbation theory, which partially describes how gauge bosons may be exchanged between particles. Unfortunately, there *are* things we don't know, or rather that this does not describe. Like bound states and solitons.

But what of it? Conjecture is not evidence. Nor is it descriptive, predictive, or particularly useful in any way in the observed nature of the universe.

&gt;If a Deity exists or does not, it is unproven as of yet.

True.

&gt;Atheists have a theory that one (or more) does not exist because nothing has been observed by people.

I can only speak for myself, but I have a *reasonable hypothesis* (not a theory) that it is *unlikely in the extreme* due to utter and complete lack of any evidence that would lead anyone to that conclusion. Just as I have a *reasonabe hypothesis* that it is *unlikely in the extreme* that flying pink unicorns from planet Biggledyboop hide my car keys in the couch cushions sometimes, due to the exact and precise same utter and complete lack of evidence for them.

&gt;The flipside of this is that I see a universe with complexity and that is a good indication that something is beyond our senses is happening which led to the universe's state of previous, current, and future existence. 

We all are already aware of many things that are happening beyond our senses. Fortunately, we have empirical information of those things that have led us to study, learn, and eventually devise instruments to detect some of this for us. There are many, many complex things we do not know yet. We continue to try and learn more.

&gt;The atheist will argue that there is no need to bring a deity into discussion since it may have occurred on its own.

Correct.

There is no need. Occam's Razor is a rather large issue.

&gt;But I am bothered why some are opposed to me saying that I believe a Deity did have a role. No 100% proof either way.

Because, quite simply, you create far more problems than you solve with such an outlandish proposition. First, why posit such a thing without any evidence whatsoever? Even more, why posit something without any evidence when instead of solving your problem, it *actually makes it far worse?*

You now are left with more questions than you started with. Where did this deity come from? What are its properties? Why does it exist? How can we determine its existence? If we cannot, then why does it make any sense at all hypothesize such an entity? Something that has no measurable effect on anything is the same as something that doesn't exist in every way.

&gt;My question is why so many are against me having my views when either reasoning carries similar weight. Nobody has proven anything.

Because if you believe hypothesizing unevidenced and unhelpful solutions that actually highly complicate an issue but solve nothing, predict nothing, and determine nothing can possibly *carry similar weight* then you have much to learn.

This illogical, unevidenced, unhelpful, contradictory, unexplained, non-predictive, non-measurable, non-specific and rather bizarre idea *cannot* carry any weight *whatsoever* to anybody actually interested in actually knowing.

tl;dr: Because it's balderdash. Explains nothing at all.

It's no secret that fans of ARPGs like Path of Exile tend to be passionate about the game and often enjoy discussing it with others. However, it's important to remember that not everyone is a fan of the genre and may not be open to hearing the praise of the game. Preaching to the choir of course will induce an accord regardless of the strength of the argument, but if we take it to someone else, let's say showing his review to someone that doesn't like ARPG, it probably won't convince any of those people to seriously explore and enjoy the game.

Instead, it's important to approach the subject from a different angle. Explain why the game is enjoyable in a way that doesn't rely on the player's familiarity with the genre. Talk about the game's unique features, its story, and its replayability. Explain why you personally enjoy the game and why you think others would too. Most importantly, be respectful and understanding of the other person's opinion, even if they don't share your enthusiasm.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/pathofexile with title ""Preaching to the Choir of course will induce an accord regardless of the strength of the argument, but if we take it to someone else, let's say showing his review to someone that doesn't like ARPG, it probably won't convince any of those people to seriously explore and enjoy the game.""","That would be the same situation as someone that doesn't like cupcakes selling cupcakes to people that already like cupcakes.

Review should be a critical ""view"" of whatever the topic is in question. Regardless if it's a book, movie, game, restaurant, etc, it should provide an in-dept write-up as to whole experience rather than just a portion of it. You can't review a movie by it's poster alone, nor a book by it's cover and the table of content, and it doesn't serve a restaurant justice if all you did was go in to use their restroom, and come out to write a review about the entire restaurant and recommend it to all your friends. 

There are well-intended but ill-advise decisions, and there are discerning and critical options. The first one is much like cigarette smoking back in the 30's. It was thought to be helpful with depression, digestive problems, and stress. Doctors suggested them with best intention at heart, but that later on turn out to be a bad idea. The latter would be someone that truly studies the benefit of nicotine, looks at how certain cultures have chew nicotine leaves to help them stay alert on long hunts, how natural nicotine plants have medicinal benefits and write a report on that with regards to the danger of cigarette smoking.

TL;DR Preaching to the Choir of course will induce an accord regardless of the strength of the argument, but if we take it to someone else, let's say showing his review to someone that doesn't like ARPG, it probably won't convince any of those people to seriously explore and enjoy the game."

Makes your opponent commit resources first instead of you.

Have you ever been in a situation where you had a powerful card in hand, but were afraid to cast it first because your opponent might have a counter? Or maybe you had a great combo in hand, but you were worried that your opponent would stop it before you could execute it?

If so, then you should consider making your opponent commit their resources first before you commit yours. By making your opponent go first, you can assess their board state and decide whether or not it's safe to cast your powerful spells or execute your combo.

This strategy is especially effective when playing control decks, as they often rely on being able to counter or remove threats before they can become a problem. By making your opponent commit their resources first, you can ensure that they don't have the resources to stop you.

Try it out and see how it works for you!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/magicTCG with title ""Makes your opponent commit resources first instead of you.""","Unless your creatures are going to directly impact combat somehow.  (Haste, pumping your guys, etc.), by attacking first you may force your opponent to make a decision.  For example, the defending player has 3 mana up and both an Azorius charm in hand and a dissipate.  If he uses his mana in combat to bounce your guy, perhaps you can cast a creature without it being countered.

The reverse is true as well; maybe we'll hold off on using that Azorius charm, just in case you cast a nasty spell in Main Phase 2.  If you always wait, your opp doesn't know if you are planning to just pass the turn or do something else.

tl;dr: Makes your opponent commit resources first instead of you."

It's something that I've noticed in Magic: the Gathering. When you attack with a creature, you want to make sure that your opponent has as little information as possible when deciding which creature to block with. One way to do this is to play creatures with multiple abilities, such as flying, first strike, and trample. This way, your opponent won't know which ability you will use to attack with and will have to guess. Doing this can give you an edge in combat and make it harder for your opponent to make the correct blocking decision.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/magicTCG with title ""It makes your opponent have less information when in combat""","It's not a hard and fast rule, there are some creatures you might want to play before combat (ex. Goblin Warchief, Hellrider, etc). Those creatures tend to have haste and/or affect combat.

One reason could be playing around your opponents combat tricks like Wing Shards or Peel from Reality. Let's say you have a grizzly bears in your hand, and 3 creatures on the board. Playing it before combat has no real impact. If you enter your combat phase and your opponent has a Blustersquall (which she casts with overload) will leave you with no blockers for the next turn. If you cast it after combat you can at least block with a Grizzly Bears.

Another reason could be to play a combat trick or pretend that you have combat trick in your hand. This could be a Giant Growth, Restoration Angel, or Necrobite, etc. The more cards you have in your hand the more likely your opponent would have to assume you have something to affect combat, but it also ensures that you can play your trick when you need to as well. 

It can also play around Counterspell. It forces your opponent to make a decision to make a play now or take damage to make a play later in the turn. If your opponent is playing some sort of UW control deck with Counterspells and flash creatures and combat instants, then attacking first is forcing your opponent to let you know whether he or she has a counterspell or not. If your opponent just takes the damage with a fistful of cards, then you can be fairly certain that they have a counterspell (or at least really bluffing it). This is valuable information in a game.

So, those a few reasons. But ultimately it comes down to the fact that if it won't make an impact at that point, you should limit the information you give to your opponent until you have to. As you can see playing or not playing creature before combat reveals a lot. At the very least, you have one less card in your hand, and a little less mana available to you. 

tl;dr It makes your opponent have less information when in combat"

I'm a big baby and nerds make me mad. I don't understand why people like playing Magic: The Gathering so much. It seems like a waste of time and money. I don't understand why people would spend so much time and money on something that doesn't even have a tangible reward. It's just a bunch of cards and rules. I don't get it.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/magicTCG with title ""I'm a big baby and nerds make me mad.""","These feel like they all relate to a certain ""archetype"" of player, alas:

1) Stop loudly fiddling with your cards in hand during my turn, you wretch. Put them down on the table and let me think in peace. I get that you do that because it's your way of directing ""thinking stress"" and/or you are emulating some ""pros"" you saw on a stream, but please have the self awareness to stop doing that during my turn. It's annoying and unnecessary. In before: ""Nurhurhur! That's why we do it, psychological warfare! :B""

2) Verbal declarations of self perceived advantages or ""dominance."" Every case I've seen this happen tends to be meshed with childish butt hurt when the delusions are torn down. Guy won't stop jerking himself off about his ""crazy board position"" and that ""it's good game for somebody on my next turn."" Mood shifts from ""I'm extremely cocky"" to ""you killed my dog"" when that sweet board state is swept off the table. 

The best example of this happening was during a local legacy tournament. I had been on hiatus due to work for a month or two, where new guy decided to start showing up to the shop. He is relatively new to legacy, but has already picked up something of a name for himself in cocksure attitude. I dragged out a combo elves list I've had rotting on a shelf for a long while, showed up, and got paired with him. 

He was playing some iteration of The Rock or Junk (Goofies, confidants, removal, yadda yadda). First game I don't do much but fart out 1/1 elves and get dumpster banged. ""Elves doesn't have a good match up versus me!"" Second game I have another horrendous slow start, but sandbag a hand of elves and glimpse until I can explode off three lands into a hard cast Emrakul.

Suddenly -silence- and -everything is on the line- as if I am witnessing a man defusing a bomb and any mistake will cost him his life. I get a ""regular"" turn 3 blow out and summon the Kooldrazi. Wouldn't shake my hand, instead indignantly digging out three engineered plague from his deck and throwing them down on the table in front of me as a visual aid to himself explaining I ""should not win because I have these in my deck, you got lucky."" Give me a break, guy (I run a wishboard for that kind of thing! :3).

3) Honestly going to extend the first belly ache with this: I -really- loathe the habits ""pro scenes"" have invoked in local players. Stop diddling with your cards loudly, you look like you are on meth. 
Stop mechanically drawing and moving your cards around as if you are invoking the sacred rites of the .1% efficiency Goddess, you just look like a tool. 
Also, get your grubby mitts off my deck! I shuffled it a crap load, right in front of you, using a variety of methods, and all you need to do is cut it. You don't need to cut it four times, shuffle it, and randomize it again as if I'm some sort of MTG card shark that has spent my incredible gift on durdling with cards at a local tournament. 
No, I don't know about so and so player or why he thinks the card I am killing you with is a suboptimal choice. No, please don't explain it to me.

I got an IUD a few years ago and I'm so glad I did - it's been an incredibly convenient form of birth control for me.

I recently had the pleasure of playing an amazing game of Dungeons and Dragons with some of my closest friends. One of the characters was a former criminal, and he ended up becoming a great ally and friend to our group. 

At one point in the game, our group was in a desperate situation and it seemed like there was no way out. We had been fighting a powerful enemy for several days and it seemed like we were going to lose. That's when my former criminal friend stepped up and sacrificed himself to save me and the rest of the group. 

It was an incredibly emotional moment, and it really showed the power of friendship and the bonds that can be formed between characters in a role-playing game. I'll never forget that moment, and the sacrifice my friend made to save us all.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/rpg with title ""Dude plays a former criminal, sacrifices himself to save my life after several days of fighting with me""","Playing a game of Deathwatch with a combined group of seven people, two of them from Rogue Trader. I was an Apothecary (healer), running with a group of 2 Assault Marines (melee warriors), 1 Librarian (heavy armor caster), and 1 Tech Marine (technical ranged/melee). The other two were a Rogue Trader (whose ship we were 'borrowing') and an Arch-Militant who RPs as a former penal legion man.

The Rogue Trader was interesting, my party I knew, but this Arch-Militant, the way he described himself was fucking interesting. Black skinned, bald, mid-tonal voice (not deep), but most of all he never stood still. He was always walking around, always moving. He could have had a hellgun or something more powerful, but he had a combat shotgun, and always kept it close to him. 

So we get the order to hunt down some tyranids on this space hulk, and the Rogue Trader and the Arch-Militant come along. We split into two different groups again, this time the smaller Rogue Trader group need one of us to go along. I volunteer, and my Deathwatch group meets at a different day than I do with the Rogue Trader group. This guy, he ends up running with me when genestealers overwhelm the Rogue Trader's personal stormtrooper-level retinue, and we get seperated from the group. For two whole sessions, he and I bond, while running and shooting for our lives against the chitin horde following us. We don't know if the Deathwatch group is alive, if the Rogue Trader is alive, and soon the GM has us meet on Roll20 until we can rejoin the group. Eventually, we find the Brood Lord of the Genestealers, but we fail to kill it so we're on the run, hiding and ducking.

We get to this power station, where we're stuck, and I tell him in character that I'm tired of running. We should stay here and wait for our comrades, put up a defense. He says the best thing I ever seen in a game before, especially considering the shit we've done and seen:

""We're all gonna die, Artemis. The only question is how we're gonna check out. Do you want it on your feet? Or on your Emperor damned knees... begging, like a damn xeno? I ain't much for begging! Nobody ever gave me nothing! So I say *fuck* that tyranid asshole, let's fight it! Bring that thing in here and kill it!""

I was inspired, in character and out of it. We let the Brood Lord into our little area, with four other genestealers. We fought that thing and its companions for an hour almost, before I killed it with a lucky chainsword strike (Thank FFG for Righteous Fury rolls). More genestealers are coming in, and he tells me to run. 

I have to; I had several vials of gene-seed from the last mission that I didn't have time to put in their proper place. But I didn't want to; I made *two* willpower checks, hoping I'd fail my duty to save my new friend, but my will was there. With reluctance, I left him in that power room, and I made it to safety. He died surrounded by xenos.

That is probably, across Dnd, Pathfinder, Dark Heresy, Rogue Trader, Deathwatch, Only War, Black Crusade, and a score of other tabletop games that I've played over the years that I ever really felt a connection with another person's character. And probably the only one I felt bad about leaving to his fate.

As someone who loves science and space exploration, this is really interesting! It's amazing to think that something as small and seemingly insignificant as paintballs could be used to deflect an asteroid. It's also amazing to think that all of the world's nuclear weapons wouldn't even make a dent in an asteroid that's much smaller and lighter than the one in Armageddon. It's definitely a funny thought, but it's also a great reminder of how powerful and destructive nuclear weapons can be.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""We could throw ALL of the world's nukes at an oncoming asteroid much smaller and lighter than the one in Armageddon and we wouldn't even scratch the paint.

We really want to vaporise it.  Let's see how many nukes we need to do that.

This post is worked out in metric, deal with it :)

**Heat of vaporisation**

The heat of vaporisation of rock varies drastically with the composition of the rock.  However, a ballpark figure for the heat of vaporisation is worked out by someone [here](  It's probably an underestimate since it was mentioned quite a few times in the movie that the asteroid was ""made of iron"" (even if it's substantially iron that still matters).  But hey, let's just go with the flow and say that we're looking at 9 x 10^9 Joules of energy to vaporise just one cubic metre of the asteroid.

**It's the size of Texas sir**

* Texas is [696,241]( km^2
* There are no objects that size in our solar system that could possibly have remained undiscovered until now
* It the asteroid really **were** the size of Texas, it would probably crack the Earth or at least liquefy the surface
* Let's make our asteroid a bit smaller shall we?

Let's say that our asteroid and Texas have the same surface area.  Whipping out our trusty calculator, we find that the asteroid would be about 235km in radius with a volume therefore of around 17.3 x 10^15 m^3

**Energy to vaporise**

Using our back of the envelope calculations, we find that we need 15.57 * 10^25 Joules to vaporise our asteroid.

**So how many nukes man?**

The biggest nuclear device ever detonated was [Tsar Bomba]( which gave a yield of 57 megatons of TNT or 2.4 * 10^17 Joules

Turning again to our calculator, we need 6.48 x 10^8 Tsar Bombas to blow it up.  648,750,000 to be more precise, or, to put it another way, 36,978,750,000 megatons.

**World nuclear arsenal**

Our [world nuclear arsenal]( currently stands at about 17,300 weapons with an [average yield]( of 6.4 megatons.  Again, we're really just talking ballpark figures here.

So we have 110,720 megatons to throw at our asteroid, assuming that all weapons launch, lock and explode correctly.  We're off by a factor of  334,984.

**TL;DR** We could throw ALL of the world's nukes at an oncoming asteroid much smaller and lighter than the one in Armageddon and we wouldn't even scratch the paint.  Which is kind of funny since [MIT]( have an idea that we can deflect an asteroid with paintballs."

I've been a fan of Doctor Who for many years now, and one of the things I love the most about the show is the companions. Each companion brings something unique to the table, and I can honestly say I love them all. Whether it's Rose's bubbly enthusiasm, Martha's intelligence, Donna's sass, or Rory's loyalty, each companion brings something to the show that makes it even better. 

I never find myself changing the channel when a new companion or Doctor arrives, because I know the show will be just as exciting and entertaining as ever. I never judge a companion or Doctor based on their looks, their attitude, or their intelligence, because I know that each of them has something special to offer to the show. 

So, no matter who is the companion or Doctor, I will always be there to watch and enjoy. I love every companion and Doctor, and I never will you hear me say ""Ugh changed the channel, he/she is too boring/whiny/stupid/worish/ugly etc.""","give me the text of a reddit post from r/doctorwho with title ""I love every companion and Doctor.

I don't know about you, but I still remember the original Aliens vs. Predator from 1999. It was a great game, and it's still one of my favorites. The graphics were amazing for its time, and the gameplay was incredibly immersive. It was one of the few games that truly captured the feeling of the movies. 

Unfortunately, the game has not aged well. The graphics are outdated, and the controls are clunky. But the biggest issue is that it's not available on modern computers. It would be great if someone could port the original AVP to modern computers, so that we can all enjoy it once again. It would be a great way to relive the classic game, and it would be a great way to introduce modern gamers to the classic AVP.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/LV426 with title ""AVP from 1999 was way better in almost all regards than most games from today.

I am so sad that this game seems to be heavily suffering from being badly and hastily slapped together by a bunch of different developers. (Even more sad is that each one of these developers, given the chance to properly concentrate on the game, would probably have done a way better job.)

But whatever, my point is why didnt you just take the near perfect Alien vs Predator (1999):

 * Video:



 * Wiki:



 * Review:



Updated the Graphics added some more Physics (the game already was that good). And just rereleased it. I mean the original AVP is now 14 years old (damn i feel old now) and stills runs circles around newer games when it comes to replayability, atmosphere, content and even physics in some cases, for example:

Replayability:

3 huge Campaigns playing as Marine, Predator or Alien all strung together in fitting story. And each with a completely different playstyle. 

Cool Multiplayer Modes:Team Deathmatch and Deathmatch, Aliens versus Marines versus Predators, etc and even a Survival mode where the aliens attack in infinite waves (highly customizable and not as a ""DLC"")

Also you could replay every level to get better ratings and unlock cheats with unique tasks like facebite 10 humans as alien or run through while killing everything in 2 minutes as predator. I know achievements are pretty standard now but 1999.

Atmosphere:

It had a special cd especially for the soundtrack. The ping of the motion detector was like in the movies. As a marine your best lightsource was the flare that could be thrown around corners to illuminate the darkness. The other races had cool vision modes, the predator had is vision like in the movies, the alien had a cool fisheye mode.

Physics:

It had cool expanding explosions that threw stuff around (1999!!)
You could shoot stuff off the aliens (or humans with the speargun) piece by piece, every single droplet of acid or blood flew around. 

With AM:CM was hoping for a game that would be at least show some hope in regards to the old AVP. Instead again it looks like a somewhat uninspired sequel to a once great game the only ""bonus"" beeing graphics and ""DLC´s"". Which sadly seems to be common nowadays. Maybe someday there will a sequel to the good old AVP. 

Damn i just looked at the requirements for the original:

Pentium II 450
128 Meg SD-Ram
Voodoo 2 - 8mb
DirectX 6.1a

And now i feel really old and have to look where to buy the old one to test it on my actual rig :)

tl;dr
AVP from 1999 was way better in almost all regards than most games from today. Someone please port the original AVP on todays computers.

I don't think you understood the argument I was making before you decided to disagree. I was arguing that the current system of government is not working, and that we need to find a better way to ensure that our voices are heard and our needs are met.

I have to strongly disagree with you when you say they were ""at the top of their game when they visited the Alien franchise.""  In fact, that's patently false.  Both Scott and Cameron had one highly acclaimed, moderately successful project before their respective entries into the franchise.  Fincher was only one movie behind them, but like I said, he doesn't really fit.

The reason why you think that they were on top of their games during their Alien era is BECAUSE of Alien and Aliens.  That's the very point I've been making.  Also, I acknowledged that both Scott and Cameron have one other movie above reproach, namely Blade Runner and T2.  I personally think True Lies is awful, never saw the appeal of it.  Gladiator is in the same boat.  I recognize that this is not the most common opinion, but I don't at all think it's a stretch to say neither of those movies are in the class of Alien, Aliens, Blade Runner or T2.

Hey everyone,

I've been playing Runescape for a while and I've noticed that a lot of people seem to think that they need expensive armor or flipping/hosting to make money. This isn't true! Armor isn't any more expensive than it used to be, and Chaotics are free these days. Even if you don't flip or host, you aren't poor - there are a ton of ways to make good money in Runescape that don't require expensive prerequisites.

Flipping and hosting are perfectly legitimate methods of making money, but they don't have to be the only way. If you feel like you're being lazy because you don't want to invest the time and money in flipping and hosting, don't worry - there are plenty of other ways to make money that don't require such a big investment.

So don't worry - even if you don't have the money to invest in flipping or hosting, you can still make good money in Runescape. Just take the time to explore the different options available to you, and you'll be able to make money without breaking the bank. Good luck!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/runescape with title ""Armor isn't any more expensive, chaotics are free, you aren't poor even if you don't flip/host-even though flipping is perfectly legitimate and easy to do, you are just being lazy because there are a TON of ways to make good money out there that don't require expensive prerequisites.""","How is the Runescape economy fucked?

However, they are hardly necessary for anything on RS and you can make do with a chaotic weapon and lower tier armor. You are not ""poor"" if you didn't flip and host- killing the QBD can be upwards of 1m/hr. Just killing green dragons can be 500k/hr.

It's no secret that healthcare in the US is expensive. But what's even scarier is the fact that taxes are an afterthought when seeking medical attention and services.

I recently had to take my father to the emergency room after he suffered a heart attack. We spent several hours in the ER, and when it was all said and done, we had a bill for over $10,000. After insurance, we were still left with a bill of over $2,000.

When I got the bill, I was expecting to see a line item for taxes. But there was none. It was only after I asked the hospital about it that I found out that taxes don't apply to medical services.

It's just another example of how broken our healthcare system is. We pay an exorbitant amount for medical services, and then don't even get taxed for it. It's just another way for the wealthy to keep their money and leave the rest of us to foot the bill.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/WTF with title ""taxes here are an afterthought once you seek medical attention and services""","I don't know the specifics, but in Ontario we pay 13% tax on most things.

I recently had a staph boil and let me tell you, it was one of the most painful experiences of my life. It's something I wouldn't wish on anyone.

So I'm here to remind everyone that hygiene is important. Whether it's washing your hands, taking regular showers, or wearing clean clothes, taking care of your body is essential.

It's easy to forget to be hygienic, especially when you're a kid, but it's something that can save you from a lot of pain and discomfort. So please, keep yourself clean and healthy!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/WTF with title ""Kids, hygiene is important. I wish the pain of a staph boil upon no one.""","I got my first run-in with this back in October, it was horrible.  It started as a serious pimple on my upper, inner thigh and intensified from there.  In no more than a day's time, the abscess swelled to the size of an egg with a small, thumbtack-sized head that would not pop open.  

After about three days, the pain was so unbearable that I chose to handle it on my own.  I iced it for about 30 minutes, to the point that I felt NOTHING in my thigh.  I grabbed the sterilized (fire, then alcohol) razor blade I had near me and sliced into it.  Even with all that numbness, it still hurt so bad I nearly fainted.  After I had a slit big enough for the other end of a thumbtack to squeeze into, I iced it again as puss and blood oozed out.  After about another 10 minutes, I squeeze the fuck out of it, releasing ~half a shot glass worth of a puss and blood mixture.  It was the worst smelling thing I'd ever smelled, kind of like gym socks mixed with sweaty taint.  I gauzed it up and decided to head to the doctor the following day to get some antibiotics.  The doctor put a ""wick"" in that I was to keep there for 48 hours.  A wick, in these terms, is when the doctor balls up very thin guaze and packs it tightly into the abscess to a) Prevent it from refilling, and b) Keep it from healing so it can properly drain.  Taking that out was nearly as painful as slicing into it myself.  

Flash forward to last Thursday.  I have a zit on my right ass cheek, which is not unheard of because I'm a hairy mofo.  I attempt to pop it, fail, and figure that it's not mature enough.  I check on it again Friday night due to some discomfort I had at work that day - it's another fucking boil, this one much smaller than my last one (roughly the size of a large grape).  I can't get a good angle so I got to wait until Monday to have the doctor slice it open.  The pain I felt all weekend was horrible.  I couldn't sit right at all and have never felt so much discomfort across my entire body in my life.  After having it sliced opened and drained, the doctor wicked it as well.  I took the wick out late last night because the discomfort was so unbearable.  It was like having a hot coal stuck under your skin.  Here I am today, changing bandages about every 8-10 hours due to light puss and excessive blood still draining from it.  

The hygiene I had kept the first time was apalling.  I coulding shower for three days because I could get the bandaging or wick wet.  The first time, I lost three pairs of underpants that were covered in blood and puss.  This time I'm going to lose one pair.

If anyone has any suggestions to prevent this, PLEASE... **FUCKING PLEASE** tell me.  I am a pretty hygienic person already, shower well daily, wash my hands after every bathroom use, rarely shit in public and, if I do, I lay a thick ass nest.  

Images (first infection, upper, inner thigh):

* This is the beginning.  The head is that greyish dot in the middle of the red.  Anywhere you see red is part of the abscess. [Link](

* Better shot of beginning (after an attempted pop) [Link](

* Puss oozed out at the lightest of touches.  Horrible smell.. [Link](

* This was taken after I removed the wick.  99% of the puss is gone and I'm left with a blood filled hole.  Standing up caused puddles of blood to drain out of the hole. [Link](

* Aftermath of wick removal.  A boatload of TP spent sopping up blood and puss.  That long, red string?  Yeah, that's the wick.  That yellowish blob at the one end?  yeah, that a blood/puss clot that came out at the end.  It was nearly solid and caused such agonizing pain that I nearly fainted..again.. [Link](

As someone who is in a non-monogamous relationship, I know how important it is to feel safe, secure, recognized, appreciated, desired, etc. during group sex. It can be intimidating to be in a situation with multiple partners, and feeling at ease is essential for the experience to be enjoyable.

One way to ensure that you feel safe and secure is to communicate openly and honestly with your partner and the other people involved. Talk about boundaries and expectations beforehand and make sure everyone is on the same page.

Another way to make sure your needs are being met is to focus on the connection between you and your partner. If you feel that your needs are being satisfied by your partner, even while they are with another person, you might not feel as jealous.

Finally, it's important to take care of yourself during group sex. Make sure you're comfortable and relaxed, and that your needs are being met. If something doesn't feel right, speak up and let your partner know.

Group sex can be an incredibly rewarding and fulfilling experience, but it's important to make sure you feel safe, secure, recognized, appreciated, and desired. With proper communication and self-care, you can make sure that your needs are being met and that you are having a positive experience.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/nonmonogamy with title ""Discuss ways that will help you feel safe, secure, recognized, appreciated, desired, etc. during group sex. If you feel that those needs are being satisfied by your partner, even while they are with another person, you might not feel as jealous.""","The following has worked well for me: I ask myself, what are my basic needs, and how is this feeling of jealousy connected to the possibility that those needs will not be met during the group sex encounter?

A few principles inform the way I go about answering the above question. To be clear, I don't mean to suggest that the following definition of ""needs"" is objectively true. It just helps me to overcome jealousy when I think about needs in this way. And my hope is that it will help other people as well.

Also, my apologies for using hetero pronoun pairings throughout... I don't mean to assume anything about your gender or orientation; I'm just relying on my own experience.

1) There is a difference between a need and a strategy. 

2) A strategy is any approach that I use to attempt fulfilling a need. 

3) A need is very basic and universal. For example, I need to feel safe. I can go about fulfilling that need in a lot of different ways, and in a lot of different situations. At home, for example, locking my doors helps me to feel safe. In group sex, for example, one of the strategies that I use to feel safe is wearing a condom. And so on.

4) Crucially, my needs can never conflict with another person's needs. Chances are, if I feel like my needs are conflicting with those of another person, it is actually our strategies that conflict. For example, I might want to clean up immediately after sex, and my partner might want to cuddle immediately after sex. Those are both strategies to meet more basic needs, and their immediacy puts them in conflict. But, at a more basic level, I might need to feel physically comfortable in terms of cleanliness. My partner might need to feel connected and reassured. If we put our needs in these more basic terms, we can work together to satisfy them using a number of other strategies. For example, she could join me in the shower, and we could maintain physical closeness while we clean up. I can reassure her verbally, and let her know that physical contact is important to me as well. I can wait for a little while immediately after sex, and focus on maintaing physical closeness until we're both in a good place, before I rush off to have a shower. And so on.

5) It is very easy to confuse needs and strategies. And it takes a lot of communication and cooperation to figure out, in any given situation, which is which. Often, we have strong inclinations towards particular strategies, and they start to feel like needs. For example, perhaps my partner has *always* cuddled immediately after sex. Maybe she has even ended relationships because her ex refused to cuddle immediately after sex. She might tell me that she needs this cuddling. She might demand it, suggesting that it is the price of admission for our relationship to continue. For her, this strategy is so effective at fulfilling a specific cluster of needs that she experiences after sex, that she assumes it is the only strategy that could possibly work. It might even end up being true that we cannot find any other strategies that effectively satisfy her needs after sex. But, nonetheless, cuddling is still a strategy and not a need. And it is worth exploring other possible strategies to meet both of our needs, if we identify a conflict stemming from her desire to cuddle and my desire to clean.

***

OK, jealousy. I can't speak for the needs that you are expressing when you write that you ""have a lot of trouble trying to think about them being physical with someone as passionately as they are with me."" But I can speak about my experience feeling jealous along the same lines.

For me, the thought of my partner being as physically passionate with someone else as they are with me makes me feel worried about a few different things. For one, I worry that my partner finds the other person more attractive and more desirable than they find me. In other words, I need to feel attractive and desirable, and seeing my partner pay attention to another person's body instead of mine makes me feel those specific needs in a very pronounced way. So, the question becomes are there strategies that we can use to meet my need to feel desirable at the same time that my partner has sex with someone else? One of the strategies that works really well for me is if my partner makes eye contact with me and talks dirty to me while having sex with the other person. Feeling her eyes connect with mine, even if it's just periodically throughout the encounter, and hearing her describe her desire for me really helps to meet my needs to feel attractive, and eases the sense of conflict that arises from her being physically engaged with someone else.

Another thing that I worry about when I think of my partner being physically passionate with someone else is that I will be excluded or rejected by means of her passionate connection with the other person. Put differently, I need to feel accepted and included. One of the strategies that helps me to meet this need is if my partner physically engages with me while she has sex with the other person. If she reaches out to touch my body, or stimulate me in some way, I feel like she wants me to be part of the encounter as much as or more than she enjoys being with the other person.

To come full circle, jealousy (for me) is linked to the possibility that my partner might not meet my needs to feel attractive, desirable, accepted, and included during group sex. The fact that I'm having sex with other people helps to meet those needs, which is part of why group sex is so appealing. But I also need to feel connected, and I worry that my connection with my partner might be put in jeopardy by her feeling connected to someone else. That said, having a frank discussion about needs and worries helps me to feel connected to my partner. So, I find that it is useful to discuss worries, needs and strategies with my partner – not only before the group sex, but after as well... and sometimes even during. I've written this post in really formal terms, for the sake of clarity, but in practice, it doesn't have to be clunky. It's gotten to the point now where I use dirty talk, at least partially, to suss out what my partner's needs are and what strategies we can employ to go about meeting those needs.

**TL;DR** - Discuss ways that will help you feel safe, secure, recognized, appreciated, desired, etc. during group sex. If you feel that those needs are being satisfied by your partner, even while they are with another person, you might not feel as jealous."

Hey everyone,

If you're thinking about getting into airsoft, I'm here to tell you that you won't regret it. Airsoft is a great way to have fun while also getting some exercise and honing your skills. Whether you're a beginner or a veteran, there's something for everyone.

You'll definitely enjoy doing it, so go for it! There are lots of different types of airsoft guns, so you can find something that fits your budget and your play style. And if you don't have anyone to play with, there are plenty of online forums and communities you can join to find other airsoft players.

So if you're looking for a fun and exciting way to spend your free time, give airsoft a try!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/airsoft with title ""You'll definitely enjoy doing it, so go for it!""","I'm working on a U.S. Ranger impression myself. It definitely gives me something to do in between playing games. While I'm not playing Airsoft, I'm looking for more pieces to complete my impression. Whether it's parts to complete my Mk 18 mod 1, some Ranger Green pouches to throw on my PC, or another small detail to add to my lid. It definitely takes the game to another level. Some people will criticize you for spending tons of money on the stuff, but I'm probably the poorest airsofter out there and I'm easily able to purchase stuff, if I look in the right places. Some people that are actually in the military will also criticize you for wearing all the stuff. I've had no problems with that so far. I always viewed these guys as my heroes and role models while I grew up, so that's why I imitate them. Even as I'm in college for my Criminal Justice major, I still think about joining the military. I still don't know exactly what I want to do with my life, but I know I will figure it out soon. Before I go telling my whole life story, I'll just say that you should definitely do an impression, and you'll always have something to do (e.g. always looking for that one extra/unique piece to complete your kit).

TL;DR: You'll definitely enjoy doing it, so go for it!"

This is an interesting question. It's true that many people are on multiple sites, but why? It could be for a variety of reasons. 

For starters, people may be on multiple sites to expand their social network. They may be looking to meet new people with similar interests, or to keep up with friends or family members who are on other sites. 

Another reason someone may be on multiple sites is to keep up with different topics. For example, someone may use one site to stay up to date on politics, and another to stay informed about the latest tech news. 

Some people may also use multiple sites for entertainment. They may use one site for gaming, and another for watching videos or streaming music. 

Finally, people may be on multiple sites to stay in touch with their professional network. They may use one site to network with colleagues, and another to stay up to date on job postings. 

In short, there are many legitimate reasons why someone may be on multiple sites. Everyone has their own reasons and motivations, so it's important to respect their choices.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskSocialScience with title ""there exist legitimate reasons why someone would want to be on more than one site.""","Let me try again:

&gt;If you pay for one, would you actually pay for more than one subscription?

OkTrends wrote a piece about how dating websites function. After OkCupid was aquired by Match.com the piece was removed from their site. Here is a wayback link to the story:

[Why You Should Never Pay For Online Dating](

The important takeaway is that without joining and engaging with the site (i.e. emailing people and getting their replies) it is impossible to determine if the people you see listed in the searches are still subscribing members. Part of the business model is to leave the profiles of no-longer-paying folks ""live"", and if you email them the site sends them a ""you've got mail"" notification, but they have to pay to read that mail.

So, to answer the question cairnn5556 posed: a paying customer has no way of knowing if dating site A or dating site B has any customers on it to date so joining both is a legitimate strategy.

If dating site A was ""in"" and now the crowd has gravitated to dating site B *both* sites will outwardly appear as if they are populated with ""live"" profiles. If you live in a small town then this can make a huge difference.

Sorry if the other response was short. It was on my phone, the answer seemed obvious and I knew the oktrends url was going to be a pain to retrieve.

additional anecdote: many people I emailed or dated on the more populated site were also on other sites. 

tl;dr there exist legitimate reasons why someone would want to be on more than one site."

I recently had a customer call in who was having trouble with their computer. They told me that they had been trying to fix the issue for days but nothing was working. After a few minutes of troubleshooting, I finally found the issue and solved it.

The customer was so grateful and thanked me profusely. As they were thanking me, they said something that really resonated with me. They said, ""You know, it's not the technology that's hard to use, it's the people who don't know how to use it.""

It really made me think about how true that statement is. Technology is supposed to make our lives easier but it can be difficult when people don't know how to use it. That's why tech support is so important!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/talesfromtechsupport with title ""Resonates.""","As an englishman, your TL:DR Resonates. "

Hey everyone, 

I recently got into a discussion with another member of a chatroom about how Gilda from My Little Pony has a wall thicker than Pink from Pink Floyd's The Wall. We got into a deep philosophical discussion about what magic is and how it relates to Quantum Physics and String Theory. 

It was a fascinating conversation and I wanted to see what other people thought about it. Do you think Gilda's wall is thicker than Pink's? Do you think there's a connection between magic and Quantum Physics and String Theory? Let me know what you think in the comments!","give me the text of a reddit post from r/mylittlepony with title ""Gilda has a wall thicker than Pink from Pink Floyd's The Wall. 
 I can write out more, such as me and a chatroom member discussing what magic is and how it relates to Quantum Physics and String Theory, if you want.""","1) Gilda's Past

Gilda was born in the home nation of the gryphons, as normal. But, as a child, all those close to her were taken from her abruptly in a mass enslavement by the Diamond dogs. Her parents sacrificed themselves to save her. This leads to deep seated mistrust and personality issues. 

After this, she was lost, hungry, and wounded for several days. She wound up being found by Cloudsdale Guards, and taken to the local orphanage. 

After a few years of living under typical orphanage, she was chosen to be adopted, by a pony couple, one of whom was infertile. She immediately takes a disliking to them, think aforementioned trust issues.

This hate grew into the typical 'burnout douchebag' persona. Her 'parents' tried to give the best to her, by paying for expensive flight lessons and school. Of course, she fails them and rebels intentionally. Around this time, Dash enters the picture. They become immediate freinds, with RD's personality rubbing off on her, so she becomes a bit more mellow. The time comes when they must graduate, and Gilda is not able to. Dash graduates, moves on, while Gilda is left all alone. SHe reverts to her former self loathing self. She runs away from Cloudsdale, to never return, for fear of rejection, hate, and scorn.


TL:DR Gilda has a wall thicker than Pink from Pink Floyd's The Wall.

It happens to me all the time. I'm out for a walk, and I find myself drawn to a tree. I don't even think about it, I just walk up to it and give it a hug. It's like I'm drawn to it, like it's calling me.

But I do it intentionally. I'm drawn to trees because they're a source of peace and tranquility. I find myself feeling calmer and more at ease when I'm around them. I find myself taking a few moments to just take in the beauty of the tree and appreciate its presence.

It's a ritual I've been doing for years now, and it's something that I look forward to doing. Trees are a reminder to me that nature is beautiful and that it's important to take a moment to appreciate it.","give me the text of a reddit post from r/trees with title ""it happens to me, but I do that intentionally.""","Something similar can happen to me if I take a hit in a certain way. Temporary auditory hallucinations occur (for like 3 seconds, ""underwater effect, etc."") And occasionally get blurred sight for a couple seconds. I noticed it happens when I take afull inhale, hold and compress, and release really slow. I think its a combination of rapidly getting high, holding your breath, and improper (or in my opinion, proper) hit taking. I enjoy the effects, but only hit it like that when I am not driving.

TL; DR it happens to me, but I do that intentionally."

I'm sure a lot of us have seen the movie Magic Mike, but what do you think is the difference between true happiness/love and the fantasy portrayed in the movie? What do you think it takes to achieve true happiness and love in life?","give me the text of a reddit post from r/AskReddit with title ""Happiness/love, and  not  the movie Magic Mike.""","Being happy, my boyfriend knows exactly how to do it (in a non sexual way.) When I had a fever he surprised me with vicks vapor rub, an italian ice in my favorite flavor from a place we go to, and a movie that I ^^secretly wanted to see in theaters but never got to.

The movie? Magic Mike. 

I kept telling him no because he obviously does not want to watch men dance around mostly naked, but he painfully put it in the DVD player and turned it on. He's such a sweetheart, and the movie was actually boring. Sure it's exciting at some parts, but the actual plot of the movie made no sense and they didn't talk loud enough. I actually turned it off because all the scenes of Channing Tatum grinding didn't make up for the shitty movie.

**tl;dr:** Happiness/love, and ***not*** the movie Magic Mike."
